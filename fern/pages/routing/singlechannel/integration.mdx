Integrating a **Single Channel Route** into a notification event allows it to be used effectively.

This is done by simply adding the **Single Channel Routing** instead of **Providers**

The understanding here is that adding providers gives you the basic set-up of a single **Provider** for a specific notification type (SMS, WhatsApp, etc.).

On the other hand, **Single Channel Routing** allows you to create redundancies and other conditions, with multiple **Providers**, effectively making a complex structure in minutes.

To use a **Single Channel Route**, select the one you want while setting up the [Configuration](./event-creation#3-configuration), in **Notification Events**.

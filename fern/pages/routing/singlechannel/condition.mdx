The "**Condition**" operator within the flow-builder allows you to experiment with a wide range of options by putting conditions to allow or deny an action from basically happening.

The range of actions that can be achieved with such flexibility is limited only by imagination!

On creating a **Single Channel Route** and selecting **Condition**, there are a few components that you will see:

1. Key
2. Operator
3. Value

To understand this better, let's have a look at the options we have here.

# Key

**Key** field allows you to select a field or a component within a notification (it may even be a component within the payload, not just the notification content!)

On collapsing the menu, you can see the following options:

1. Destination
2. Country
3. Variable

## 1. Destination

**Destination** refers to the end-point or recipient of the notification.

A destination may be anything from:

1. Number - Mobile numbers, including country code
2. Email ID - Personal, official, etc.
3. ID Tokens - Unique token IDs for applications like Push (Expo, FCM) or Chat (Slack, Teams)

## 2. Country

The option **Country** allows you to apply a condition to any notification which is directed towards a specific destination. This is identified by the country code of a phone number. The implications of the same can be many, based on how the redirections are done.

From blocking entire traffic to specific countries to re-directing the traffic through specific operators, the options are limitless.

## 3. Variable

A **Variable** (placeholder, dynamic or replaceable parameters) is a component within a message that has user-specific details that are unique.

Based on placeholder data, Fyno has the capacity of implementing rules. This can be anything from identifying OTP data and re-routing through a premium provider or blocking explicit or spamming content which is not allowed.

> ðŸ“˜ A "**Variable**" can be a message content or Meta-data that is pushed with the API request.
>
> If you have variable information that can govern a message being triggered or not, but not necessarily a part of the message content, this can be pushed as meta-data, and a variable dependent condition can be configured in "**Single Channel Routing**" to regulate this.

# Operator

An **Operator** helps to apply a condition on the **Key** and return the desired value or outcome.

Operators that can be used on Fyno's application are:

1. Greater Than
2. Less Than
3. Greater Than or Equal
4. Less Than or Equal
5. Equals
6. Starts With
7. Ends With
8. Contains
9. In

These operators, in combination with the **Key** field, help apply rules that will help eventually affect the output and consequent action.

# Value

The **Value** lets you input the "true" value that you want to base your action on, thus directing the entire rule, to a result.

To help you understand better, let's take an example of the same with the other fields **Key** and **Operator** in play.

# Condition Outcomes

Every condition that is defined or written will have 2 outcomes:

1. True
2. False

On setting the factors governing any **Condition**, the outcome based on if that condition is "**True**" or "**False**" will need to be defined.

This is done very simply by providing you with the below options in both scenarios:

1. "Action" Operator
2. "Condition" Operator
3. Do Nothing

> ðŸš§ Ensure your Routes makes logical sense and is a closed loop, to avoid gaps.

# Understanding How Conditions Work

Let's take an example to understand how **Conditions** work within Routing.

In this scenario, our problem statement is:

> ðŸ¤” **_Block traffic towards a country, Belgium, without any other country's traffic affected._**

The way to achieve this is by:

1. Create a new route under the SMS tab from the ribbon menu on **Routing**.
2. From the **Key** drop-down, select Country
3. From the **Operator** drop-down, select equals
4. Finally, from the **Value** drop-down, find and select Belgium
5. Save the configuration.
6. This will then show you the actions you can do if the **Condition** is "**True**" or "**False**"
    1. Under the arm that shows "**True**", we select "**Do Nothing**" since we do not want these messages to be triggered.
    2. Under the arm that shows "**False**", we select "**Action**" or "**Condition**" and define what needs to happen with the traffic going to all other countries EXCEPT Belgium.
7. This essentially covers over problem statement of "Blocking traffic towards Belgium"
8. Ensure to save and **Publish** your work.

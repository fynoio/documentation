Fyno's Single Channel Routing allow you to work with multiple providers for a specific channel.

### What is a Single Channel Route?

"Single Channel Routing" helps you decide how exactly you would like to route your notification, for any provider that is already configured within each of your channels.

You can choose to do anything from doing a specific action like route traffic through a different operator, based on the mobile number series or route traffic in a round robin fashion across multiple service providers, to adding a provider as 'failover'. That flexible!

### Why do I need Routing?

Single Channel Routing gives you the freedom to plan and build redundancies between your providers. No more downtimes with Fyno's Routing feature!

Single Channel Routing also can help you easily plan for commitments with your providers and help achieve this seamlessly without manual monitoring and switch-overs

Single Channel Routing can also help target specific audiences based on conditional routing, explained in the next sections.

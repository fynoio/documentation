## Getting Started with Campaigns

You can navigate to **Campaigns** by finding it on the left navigation panel.

Let's run through the **Campaigns** Page to have a better understanding of how it works.

On the landing page, you will see:

-   An option to provide a name for your new campaign
-   An option to download a sample CSV file of how the data would need to be uploaded.
-   Sample CSV file is shown below. Every record in the file should have either distinct_id or at least 1 destination. Otherwise it will show as Not Valid after uploading the file.
-   Use distinct_id if you are using Fyno's user profile.
-   You can also other data points in data_columns if you need them in your template placeholders.

### Campaign Status

| Status     | What it means                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Saved      | When Campaign is created after CSV file is uploaded and when user clicks 'Save as Draft'.                                                                                                     |
| Processing | When Campaign is Fired , it goes into Processing state.                                                                                                                                       |
| Fired      | When campaign is successfully executed. This means all notifications are either Sent or in Queued state                                                                                       |

| Error      | When Campaign gets Fired successfully but any error occurs. The status will become Error, only when we encounter any issues like Uploaded file is not accessible etc.                         |

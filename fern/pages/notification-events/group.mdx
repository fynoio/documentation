Notification Events Groups help you organize related notification events together. For instance, if you have multiple notification events for different order statuses (Confirmed, Cancelled, Shipped, InTransit, Delivered), you can create an 'Order Management' group and assign all these notification events to it. This makes notification events filtering and management more efficient.

## How to create a Notification Event Group

1. Navigate to Notification Events page from the left nav.
2. You will find 'Group' option on the left side of the notification events page.
3. Click '+' to add a new group.
4. Enter a group name and you can select the notification events you want to be part of this group

5. Click 'Create Group'.
6. A new group 'Order_Management' will be created and all the selected notification events will be added to the group.
7. You can see the new group under 'Groups' section (5 denotes the no of notification events under this group) and also the notification event with 'Group name' in their card.

## What is Preferences ?

Preferences make it easy for your users to manage their notification preferences they want and and select preferred channels for receiving notifications.

This can be accomplished by creating Subscription topics that users can toggle on and off, enabling them to specify the channels through which they prefer to receive each notification.

You can access Preferences from the Navigation menu. User -> Preferences.

> ðŸ“˜ The Preferences feature can be accessed only if your user details are managed through Fyno's User Profile.

## How it works?

1. Create a Section. Section are a group of subscription topics. For example, you can have a section such as Engagement, which will have all the subscription topics linked to Engagement like Resurrection, Activation, etc.
2. Create a Subscription. Subscriptions are specific type of notification you send to users. For Example, Under Engagement section, you can have subscriptions like Resurrection, Activation etc.
3. You can add channels to each subscription and select one the states - ON, OFF, REQUIRED.
4. You can select any subscription while creating a notification event. The list of all notification events will be linked to a particular subscription.
5. You can add users to Subscription and add the preference of users for any channel linked to the Subscription.

> When creating a new User Profile, the first thing you need to specify is if the user is a **Test** or **Live** user. You can create a user as 'test user' by checking the option - 'Make it a test user'
>
> **This cannot be changed later or at any point in the future.**

The fields present in the form are:

A single user profile will be added after successful submission.

> 📘 Things to Remember
>
> -   The **Distinct ID** must be unique, and a duplicate Distinct ID entry will give you an error.
> -   The minimum required length for a **Name** is 3.
> -   All the other details are optional and can be added later by updating the user profile.
> -   Status disabled means that that user will be rendered **Disabled** and wouldn't receive **ANY** notification.

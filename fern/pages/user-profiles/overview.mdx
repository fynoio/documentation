A **User Profile** contains all the information about a user which is required to send out any notification.

All the data related to a user, along with the details of notifications sent, and much more are stored within a user profile. This includes basic user information like Name, specific channel-wise information and custom user information to ensure the successful delivery of notifications.

All this information is connected to a unique identifier called a **Distinct ID**, which can then be used to fire any type of notification.

With the introduction of **Distinct ID**, you can replace your data payload that may contain information like email, sms, or push token. The **Distinct ID** then becomes the identifier to pick up the relevant information required to fire the notification through any channel.

## Why User Profiles?

User Profiles bring all the user data and the notification logs sent to that user in one place. You don't have to pass any user related information in the payload. You can access it directly from User profile. It helps you get the best use of your user data and fire notifications efficiently and effectively.  
It allows you to:

-   Fire notifications with just a single **Distinct ID**
-   Have the ability to enable or disable all notifications for any user
-   Manage your users' notifications with preferences and intelligence
-   View all the notifications sent to that user

On the listing page of **User Profiles** you will see a list of all your created users, with certain details pertaining to that account, which are the "**User Properties**" for that account.

**Distinct ID** is an ID that is associated with a specific User ID and is unique to that User ID. No two **User Profiles** can have the same **Distinct ID**.

Apart from **Distinct ID** the other properties that are visible for each account are:

### General user properties:

-   Name

2. **Test and Live Toggle Tabs**: A user profile could be of either type: **Test** or **Live**. Profiles created within either environment are similar and work in the same way.

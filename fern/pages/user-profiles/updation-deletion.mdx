## Updating User Profiles

Updating a user profile is not something one would do regularly or frequently, but it is a necessary feature, when it comes to the addition of, let's say a new channel or if there is a change in the details.

> ❗️ Distinct ID is not editable

The process of updating the **User Profile** is as below:

1. Clicking on the User's tab from the left navigation tab will open up the User Profile Listing page.
2. You can click the DistinctId of the user you want to edit and the User details page open as shown below.
3. Once you have made the changes to the details, click on the **Update** button next to **User Properties**.

## Deleting User Profiles

Deleting a profile, while it may not be an activity that is done frequently, is necessary, for various reasons.

You can delete a **User Profile** by following the below steps:

1. Click on the **Users** tab from the left navigation panel to open the **User Profile** listing page.
2. From the listing page, navigate to the user profile to be deleted and select the checkbox next to it. On selecting the checkbox, the "**Delete**" option appears on the top right corner of the page. Click on delete.

> 📘 Select multiple user profiles via the checkbox to bulk delete user profiles.

3. The confirmation dialog box will prompt you to reconfirm since it's a deletion.

> 🚧 A User Profile once deleted cannot be recovered!

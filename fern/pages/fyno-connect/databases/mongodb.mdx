To connect Fyno Connect with your MongoDB Database:

<Steps>
  <Step>Navigate to **Databases** and click on MongoDB.</Step>
  <Step>In the pop-up, enter a name for the new connection and paste the MongoDB connection string or URL.</Step>
  <Step>Click on "Add Database" to test the connection and successfully save it. After the database is added successfully, you will see it listed on the same page under **Connected DBs**.</Step>
  <Step>You can now create cohorts from the data in your database. See [Create Cohorts.](./create-cohort)</Step>

<Tip title="Make sure your MongoDB connection string is on point!">The standard connection string format looks like: `mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1],host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]]`</Tip>

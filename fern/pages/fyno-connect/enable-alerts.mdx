Alerts are designed to help get your attention to any deviants from the norm on the Fyno Connect platform.

Let's get right into it!

There are 2 types of **Alerts** you can set up for your account.

1. Campaign Failure
2. Connect Downtime

## Campaign Failure

Campaign is the critical part of Fyno Connect's functionality. So if a campaign fails, it is important to ensure you are aware of it. For this, **Campaign Failure** alerts can be used to ensure you are on top of this.

**Campaign Failure** alert is significant since it can help you detect when any of your Campaigns are failed to send and you can take quick corrective action.

### How it works?

On enabling the **Campaign Failure** notification,

- Whenever an Campaign fails, a notification will be triggered.
- To avoid spamming, Fyno has designed the **Digest** feature to work in tandem with the **Campaign Failure** feature. This:
  - Intakes all the notifications for an Campaign failure and buckets them into each reason for failure.
  - Incrementally conveys this information, until the time it is resolved, in a summarised manner in the below-mentioned windows:
    - 30 minutes
    - 2 hours
    - 6 hours
    - 12 hours
    - 24 hours

<Info>You will receive emails at these intervals for Campaign failures. You will also receive an InApp notification on your Fyno account with more details of the failure.</Info>

## Connect Downtime

**Connect Downtime** alerts are set up for you to understand in case there are any application or performance issues with the Fyno Connect.

While we do not expect the application to face downtimes or have issues that would hinder your communications from going out, it is always good to know in case it does happen.

Fyno Connect serves as your solution for directly creating user cohorts from your Database (DB) or Data Warehouse (DW). This application runs on your infrastructure, guaranteeing 100% security.

Fyno Connect comes with a pre-configured integration with our Fyno cloud platform. This allows you to initiate any communication you've designed on the cloud platform directly to users through cohorts you've created on Connect. All of this is accomplished without the need for concerns about API integration or coding.

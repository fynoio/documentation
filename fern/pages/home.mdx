## How do customer communications work, currently?

Today, we live in an age where digitalisation has seeped into every aspect of life. In the few minutes that it will take you to read this document, you’d receive roughly about 2-4 notifications on your phone on average, yes?

Let's dig a little deeper into how notifications are triggered. A lot of large brands deploy dedicated engineers, their time, and effort into building a notification infrastructure in-house. Engineers spend precious hours writing code to build an infrastructure with multiple APIs that can trigger notifications, emails, SMS, and more, at the right time, and to the right users. Before you know it, your engineers have spent 100s of hours building something that isn’t core to your business.

Focusing efforts on building a tedious infrastructure for notifications can take away a lot of the time and effort that could have instead been spent on bettering your product.

## How Fyno solves this problem!

That's where we step in. At Fyno, we're building a unified, global communications system that brings all your channels and service providers under one roof.

Fyno will make your life easier to fire your notifications with 100% deliverability. We make sure your data is secure. Also, you don’t have to log into multiple providers to check the logs. All your logs and analytics across all providers and channels can be accessed in a single place.

Let's get started, shall we?

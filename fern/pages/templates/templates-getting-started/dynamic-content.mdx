# 1. Placeholders

Below the "Channels" section on the left, you can find placeholders. Placeholders help you to add dynamic variables in your template. Placeholders are denoted by **{{ }}** . You may define the parameters of **Placeholders** by clicking on it, which opens up a pop-up window where you can define them. Once you add any placeholders in your templates using {{}} and open the Placeholders popup, you will see an option 'New placeholders detected. Add them here?' . When you click YES, then the placeholder will get automatically added here.

Handlebars is a JavaScript library used for creating dynamic templates.

It allows you to define templates with placeholders, and these placeholders are replaced with data when the template is triggered with the information sent in the payload.

Handlebars within Fyno support features like conditional operations, loops, date time formatting, partial searches, and custom helpers, making it a very helpful tool to use when creating your templates.

You can read more about how Handlebar works [here](./fyno-verify-otp-link)

# 4. Components

The Components feature allows you to build modular, reusable elements such as headers and footers.

By creating these components once, you can easily add them into any email you create, saving time and effort.

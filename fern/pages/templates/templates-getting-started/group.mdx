Template Groups help you organize related templates together. For instance, if you have multiple templates for different order statuses (Confirmed, Cancelled, Shipped, InTransit, Delivered), you can create an 'Order Management' group and assign all these templates to it. This makes template filtering and management more efficient.

## How to create a Template Group

1. Navigate to Templates page from the left nav. Templates -> Fyno.
2. You will find 'Group' option on the left side of the templates page.
3. Click '+' to add a new group.
4. Enter a group name and you can select the templates you want to be part of this group
   ![](/images/template_group.png)
5. Click 'Create Group'.
6. A new group 'Order_Management' will be created and all the selected templates will be added to the group.
7. You can see the new group under 'Groups' section (5 denotes the no of templates under this group) and also the templates with 'Group name' in their card.

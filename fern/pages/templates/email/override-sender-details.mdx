You can override details in your email in 2 ways.

1. Using API
2. Using Email editor

## How to override sender details using API

During the integration setup, you would have specified a 'From_Email' address. If you have multiple email addresses such as [noreply@xyz.com](mailto:noreply@xyz.com), [marketing@xyz.com](mailto:marketing@xyz.com), [cs@xyz.com](mailto:cs@xyz.com), and you wish to use the appropriate email address depending on the communication you send, you can dynamically assign values to 'From_Email'. To achieve this, please follow the steps outlined below.

1. Within the integrations popup, include 'from_email' as shown below. In this example, [support@fyno.io](mailto:support@fyno.io) will serve as the default From Email if the provided email ID in the payload is not valid. If you prefer not to use the default email, simply specify 'from_email' in the respective field.

> ðŸ“˜ Adding a default 'from_email' is advisable to ensure uninterrupted communication.

2. In the Notification event payload, you need to pass the from_email as shown below. By doing so, the emails triggered via this notification event will go from '[tech@fyno.io](mailto:tech@fyno.io)'.

```Text cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.fyno.io/v1/<WorkspaceID>/test/event' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
    "event": "ReleaseNote",
    "to": {
        "email": "xyz@gmail.com"
    },
    "data": {
        "name": "Rahul",
        "key": "value"
    },
    "channel": {
        "email": {
            "override": {
                â€œfrom_email": â€œtech@fyno.io"
            }
        }
    }
}'
```

> ðŸ“˜ The same process can be followed for 'from_name' field also.

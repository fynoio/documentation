    -   **Call to Action** - Call-to-action buttons allow customers to call a phone number or visit a website (e.g., payment link, order tracking link etc) at the touch of a button. A template can have a maximum of four call-to-action buttons, two ‚Äúvisit website‚Äù, one ‚Äúcall phone number‚Äù and one ‚Äúcopy coupon code‚Äù.

        1. **Visit Website** - URLs in Call-to-Action buttons can either be static or dynamic. If you want to use dynamic URLs, you will need to provide the static part of your URL with a variable when submitting your Message Template. You can then append the suffix variable when sending your Message Template. Example for Dynamic URL - `https://example.com/static_url/{{1}}` . If you want to track URL clicks or you want to shorten a URL, you can use [Fyno Shorty](./url-shortener). To use the same, you need to add Website URL and Sample URL as shown below. In the below example, download_url is a placeholder, which you will configure while creating Fyno template.

## Common Rejection Reasons

Submissions are commonly rejected for the following reasons, so make sure you avoid these mistakes.

1. Variable parameters are missing or have mismatched curly braces. The correct format is `{{1}}`.
2. Variable parameters contain special characters such as a `#`, `$`, or `%`.
3. Variable parameters are not sequential. For example, `{{1}}`, `{{2}}`, `{{4}}`, `{{5}}` are defined but `{{3}}` does not exist.
4. The message template contains content that violates WhatsApp‚Äôs Commerce Policy: When you offer goods or services for sale, Meta consider all messages and media related to your goods or services, including any descriptions, prices, fees, taxes and/or any required legal disclosures, to constitute transactions. Transactions must comply with the WhatsApp Commerce Policy.
5. The message template contains content that violates the WhatsApps Business Policy: Do not request sensitive identifiers from users. For example, do not ask people to share full length individual payment card numbers, financial account numbers, National Identification numbers, or other sensitive identifiers. This also includes not requesting documents from users that might contain sensitive identifiers. Requesting partial identifiers (ex: last 4 digits of their Social Security number) is OK.
6. The content contains potentially abusive or threatening content, such as threatening a customer with legal action or threatening to publicly shame them.
7. The message template is a duplicate of an existing template. If a template is submitted with the same wording in the body and footer of an existing template, the duplicate template will be rejected.

## How to create multi-language template

You can add templates for multiple languages from the same template creation page and send them for Approval together or one by one. You can ado that selecting language from Add language drop down.

![](/images/e24a8cd-meta_multi_lang.png)

In this example, we have created the same template in multiple languages, English, Hindi and Tamil. If there are any validation issues in the template, you will see an error as shown below for Tamil language. In such cases, go back to template page, fix the errors and send it for approval.

Once you have submitted the templates for approval, you can track the same in External Templates page.

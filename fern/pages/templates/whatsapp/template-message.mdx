Template Message you to add pre-configured templates from the WhatsApp Business Manager platform.

1. **Synced Templates**: These templates are directly synced from Meta or Business Solution Providers (BSPs).
2. **Non-Synced Templates**: For platforms like Freshchat that do not support template syncing, you'll need to configure templates created in BSPs. All details need to be mentioned as per WhatsApp template created.

> 📘 To use any user property in your templates, you can add it in this format - `{{$user.$<user_property>}}`. For example, to add Name as placeholder from User profile, you can add it as `{{$user.$name}}`. If you want to use any custom property, then you can use it as `{{$user.<user_property>}}`

### Synced Templates

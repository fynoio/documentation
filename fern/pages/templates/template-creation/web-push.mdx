1. **Title:** This is the title for your template. While it's optional, it aids in summarizing and providing context to the template.
2. **Message Content:** This constitutes the body of the template, where the primary content is placed. It's a mandatory field that must be filled out.
3. **Icon URL**: This is the icon you wish to display on the notification.This is primarily used for displaying brand logos. You can either provide a URL or upload an image for this purpose. The recommended size of the icon is 1:1 ratio. This is a mandatory field.
4. **Action URL:** This is the link that clicking the notification will redirect to. You can enter a valid HTTP/HTTPS URL or a route beginning with "/" if you intend to route users within the same path.
5. **Action Buttons**: (Optional)
    1. Button Title- Provide a name for the button.
    2. Link - Along with the button, provide the link that clicking the button would lead to. You can either enter a valid HTTP/HTTPS URL or a route starting with “/” if you want to route them within the same path. For example, you can specify either `https://www.myntra.com/cart?product-id=123` or /cart?product-id=123.
    3. Icon - Enter a value in the format of '/img/icon.png'. This icon will not be rendered in the preview but will render in the actual notification sent.

Recommended Size is less than 1 MB. Recommended ratio for the image is 2:3. The supported file formats are JPG, JPEG, and PNG for desktop and mobile web.
8. **Time to Live**: It defines how long the push message is preserved for delivery if the device is offline or due to OEM device restrictions.The default is 259,200 seconds.

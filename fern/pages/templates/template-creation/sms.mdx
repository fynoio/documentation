Creating **Templates** for SMS's has been made super simple with Fyno's template feature.

You need to follow the below steps to create a SMS template

**Template Type**

1. Synced - Select this option, if you have synced/uploaded all DLT approved SMS templates into Fyno. All these templates will be available under Templates -> External -> SMS
2. Not Synced - Select this option if your SMS templates are not synced with Fyno.

**Synced SMS Template**

1. If you choose Synced template type, you can select the template from the dropdown. If your template has any placeholders, it will appear under 'Body variables' as shown below. Once you provide sample values for the placeholders, they will reflect in the Preview section.

2. Click **Save** which will save the template in **Test** versions. Use **Save & Promote** when you are ready to move your template into the "**Live**" version.

**Not Synced SMS Template**

1. If you choose 'Not Synced Template', you will have an overview of your message details such as Encoding type, length of the message (character count) per part, and credits being used.

2. You can enter the content of the message in the SMS template.

3. **Override Sender Id**: You can specify any approved SenderId/Header here to override the default one configured in your Integration. E.g., using SenderId CLXYZA instead of the configured CLABCD in the integration.

4. Create Text, Unicode or Flash (checkboxes to select) messages.

    1. Unicode: Unicode SMS allows you to send messages in any foreign and regional language other than English
    2. Flash:A flash message appears on the mobile device‚Äôs screen, without having to access the SMS storage application on the device.

5. Enter the DLT template ID for Indian Customers.

6. Placeholders: Below the "Channels" section on the left, you can find placeholders. Placeholders are denoted by **{{ }}**. You may define the parameters of **Placeholders** by clicking on it, which opens up a pop-up window where you can define them. You can use our Handlebar functions with your placeholders for operations such as Date formatting, number formatting, arithmetic operations etc. Check out this comprehensive guide on how to use "**[Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/)**"

7. Review your content and take a look at what your message would look like in the Preview section on the right.

8. Click **Save** which will save the template in **Test** versions. Use **Save & Promote** when you are ready to move your template into the "**Live**" version

> üìò To use any user property in your templates, you can add it in this format - `{{$user.$<user_property>}}`. For example, to add Name as placeholder from User profile, you can add it as `{{$user.$name}}`

> üìò Did you know?
>
> You can use period (.), underscore (\_) or hyphen (-) within the handlebars. Try it now!

> ‚ùóÔ∏è You cannot use only numeric values as placeholder keys!

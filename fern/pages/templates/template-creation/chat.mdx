## Slack

![](https://fynodocs.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/images/template-slack.png)

The message body can be in Text or JSON depending on the kind of input. Text allows you to send simple message text whereas JSON message body is used with the Slack Block kit Builder. In case you want to use JSON, a great place to start is "https://app.slack.com/block-kit-builder". You can design your slack message at Block Kit Builder and simply copy the JSON block to Fyno Template and paste it under JSON tab. Please note: You only need to copy the JSON array start with "[" until the closing array block "]" as shown below:-

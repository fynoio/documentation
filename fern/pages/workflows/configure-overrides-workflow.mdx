Fyno allows you to override pre-configured values within an Integration, enabling you to use different values for specific notifications in a Workflow. This flexibility is useful when you need to customize the sender information or other details based on the requirements of each notification.

For example, if you have set up "[tech@fyno.io](mailto:tech@fyno.io)" as the "from_email" address in your SES integration but want to use a different email address passed in the payload for a specific notification, Fyno enables you to achieve this by configuring overrides. This feature allows you to tailor your notifications according to your needs while maintaining the overall integration configuration.

1. Go to 'Override' tab under Settings, while configuring notification event within a worflow as shown below.

2. Select the value you want to use from the payload. For example, if you want to use the variable 'email' from the payload for 'from_email', you can do it as shown above.

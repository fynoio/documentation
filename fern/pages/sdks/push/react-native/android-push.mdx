- In your root-level (project-level) gradle file (`project_name/build.gradle`), add the Google services plugin as a dependency:

```dart title="project_name/build.gradle" wordWrap
dependencies {
  ...
  classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.15'
  ...
}
```

- In your module (app-level) gradle file (usually `project_name/app_name/build.gradle`), add the Google services plugin:

```dart title="project_name/app_name/build.gradle" wordWrap
plugins {
  ...
  id 'com.google.gms.google-services'
  ...
}
```

OR

```dart title="project_name/app_name/build.gradle" wordWrap
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

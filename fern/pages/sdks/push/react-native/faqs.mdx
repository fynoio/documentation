<Accordion title = "Pod install issue: [!] The following Swift pods cannot yet be integrated as static libraries: The Swift pod fyno-push-ios depends upon FMDB, which does not define modules. To opt into those targets generating module maps (which is necessary to import them from Swift when building as static libraries), you may set use_modular_headers! globally in your Podfile, or specify :modular_headers => true for particular dependencies.">
<p></p>
<p>Add `use_modular_headers!` in your Podfile similar to:</p>
```Text title="Podfile" wordWrap
target '<application_name>' do
  use_modular_headers!
```
<p>Also, comment the `:flipper_configuration => flipper_config,` line.</p>

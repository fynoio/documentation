Before you integrate the SDK into your React Native app, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Fyno Account**
    - You must have a Fyno account and an active workspace. Learn more about workspaces [here](./workspace-introduction).
    - Configure your Fyno Push provider in [Fyno App](https://app.fyno.io/integrations).
2. **React Native Application**
    - Ensure you have a working React Native application. If you don't, set up a new React Native project using the React Native CLI or your preferred IDE.
3. **iOS Prerequisites**
    - **Apple Developer Account**: Required for setting up push notifications on iOS. Follow the [APNs setup guide](./push-apns).
    - **Xcode**: Ensure you have Xcode installed and set up for iOS development.
4. **Android Prerequisites**
    - **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**: Set up Firebase and create a project in the Firebase Console. Download the google-services.json (for Android) or GoogleService-Info.plist (for iOS) and place them in your React Native project root folder. Follow the FCM setup guides for [Android](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup) and [iOS](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup).
    - **Xiaomi Setup**: If you intend to send push notifications to Xiaomi devices, set up a Xiaomi Developer Account and create an application in the Xiaomi push console. Refer to the [Mi Push Documentation](./push-mi-push) for more details.
5. **Development Environment**
    - **React Native**: Ensure your React Native development environment is set up and working correctly.
    - **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: IDEs like Visual Studio Code (for React Native), Android Studio (for Android) and Xcode (for iOS) are recommended.

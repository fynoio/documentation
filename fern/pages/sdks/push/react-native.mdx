Welcome to the comprehensive guide for integrating Fyno's React Native Push Notification SDK in your React Native application. This guide will walk you through the prerequisites, installation, and step-by-step configuration required to get your app ready for push notifications on both **iOS** and **Android**. We'll cover topics such as setting up Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), Apple Push Notification service (APNs), Xiaomi Push, user identification, handling errors, and troubleshooting. Let's get started!

<Warning title="Regarding multiple SDKs">Using multiple push notification SDKs in the same application may lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior. To ensure smooth functionality, it is mandatory to avoid integrating other push notification SDKs alongside this one.</Warning>

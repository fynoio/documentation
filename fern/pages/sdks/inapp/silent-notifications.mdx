These notifications lack a visible user interface element but come with valuable data payloads. To effectively use this feature, you must create a notification template in the Fyno application, specifying the template type as "silent." Additionally, developers must integrate the `onMessageReceived` event handler into the In-App SDK configuration to capture these silent notifications.

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide on creating a silent notification template in Fyno and capturing these notifications in your application.

## Creating Silent Notification Template

To create a silent notification template in Fyno, follow these steps:

<Steps>
### Access Fyno Application
Access your Fyno account and navigate to the Templates section.

### Create Template

    - Click the "Create Template" button or edit an existing template.
    - Set the template type to "Silent." This indicates that this notification template will be used for sending silent notifications.
    - Define the data payload.
    - You can leave placeholders for content that can be dynamically filled by your application.

### Final Step

Save and promote your template and it's ready to use.

</Steps>

## Handling Silent Notification

To capture the incoming silent notification in your application, You need to pass the event handlers(`onMessageReceived` and `onMessageClicked`) to the In-App SDK

### SDK Integration

Ensure you have integrated the Fyno's In-App SDK into your application by following the [Integration Guide](./fyno-in-app-react-sdk).

### Configure Event Handlers

While configuring the SDK, include `onMessageReceived` and `onMessageClicked` event handler props and pass your custom message handler methods.  
Define the message handler functions in your application to handle incoming silent notifications and to handle notification click/deleted events.

In your messageHandler function, access the silent notification data payload and perform actions based on the received data. For example

```jsx title="JSX" wordWrap
const onMessageHandler = (incoming) => {
  // Handle the silent notification data payload here
  const data = incoming.notification.additional_data;
  // Perform actions based on the data received
};

<FynoInappCenter {...config} onMessageReceived={onMessageHandler} onMessageClicked={onClickHandler} />;
```

<Note>Ensure you are using @fyno/inapp-react library - **v1.0.15 or later.**</Note>

## Use Case

Consider a scenario where users initiate payments in your application, and you want to send silent notifications to update payment information in real-time without disrupting users with visible notifications. Follow these steps to achieve this

```jsx title="JSX" wordWrap
const messageHandler = (notification) => {
  // Handle the silent notification data payload
  const data = notification.notification_content.additional_data;

  // Update the state information in your app
  updatePaymentInformation(data);
};

<FynoInappCenter {...config} onMessageReceived={messageHandler} />;
```

By creating a silent notification template in Fyno and configuring the In-App SDK with the `onMessageReceived` event handler, developers can easily send and capture silent notifications in their applications. This feature enables non-intrusive updates and real-time data synchronisation while delivering a seamless user experience.

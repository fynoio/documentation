Fyno's Flutter InApp SDK offers a comprehensive set of notification features within your app. It's designed to efficiently deliver messages, ensuring optimal performance and user experience.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following information ready

-   **Workspace ID (WSID)**: You can find your workspace ID on your Fyno [API Keys](https://app.fyno.io/api-keys) page.
-   **Integration Token**: Obtain the integration token from the [Integrations](https://app.fyno.io/integrations) page.
-   **User ID**: This should be a unique identifier for the currently logged-in user. This user ID is crucial for Fyno to send specific notifications to the right users.

## Installation

Install the package by using one of the following commands.

```Text bash
dart pub add fyno_flutter_inapp
OR
flutter pub add fyno_flutter_inapp
```

This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit `dart/flutter pub get`):

```Text yaml
dependencies:
  fyno_flutter_inapp: <latest_version>
```

Alternatively, your editor might support `dart/flutter pub get`. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.

## HMAC Signature Generation

The HMAC signature is essential for ensuring the security and integrity of your notifications. Here is an example of how to generate the HMAC signature in dart

```csharp dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:crypto/crypto.dart';

void main() {
  String signature = Hmac(sha256, utf8.encode(workspaceId + integrationToken))
      .convert(utf8.encode(userId))
      .toString();
}
```

## Usage

Import the package in your Dart file:

```Text dart
import 'package:fyno_flutter_inapp/fyno_flutter_inapp.dart';
```

### SDK Initialisation

To use the SDK in your Flutter application, initialise the SDK as follows

```Text dart
final FynoInApp fynoInApp = FynoInApp();

//Web Socket connection
fynoInApp.fynoInAppSocketConnect(
	workspaceId,
  integrationId,
	userId,
  origin,
	signature,
);
```

### Reset SDK

To reset the Inapp SDK, typically during logout, call the fynoInapp.reset() function.

```Text dart
fynoInApp.reset();
```

There are 3 ways you can configure the InApp UI.

1. Fyno UI
2. Fyno Customisable UI
3. Your own UI

### Fyno UI

```Text dart
fynoInApp.getFynoNotificationIconButton(
  context,
  <icon_color>,
),
```

### Fyno Customisable UI

To customise the Fyno UI, you can pass the notification icon and colours you would like to use for the inapp notification inbox.

As of now, you can only change notification icon to any of the built in icons.

You can do the customisation as follows:

```
fynoInApp.getFynoNotificationIconButton(
    context,
    <icon_color>,
    notificationIcon: <notification_icon>,
    themeConfig: ThemeConfig(
        lightBackground: <light_background>,
        darkBackground: <dark_background>,
        lightText: <light_text>,
        darkText: <dark_text>,
        primary: <primary>,
    ),
)
```

**lightBackground** (optional) - The background color in light mode

**darkBackground** (optional) - The background color in dark mode

**lightText** (optional) - The text color in light mode

**darkText** (optional) - The text color in dark mode

**primary** (optional) - The background color of primary buttons (if any) in the notification

### Your own UI

You have the flexibility to build your own UI. Additionally, you can personalise the icons for actions like 'Read all' and 'Delete all' with your own custom designs. If you are going to use this approach, it is necessary to invoke the following functions.

1. Count of all InApp notifications (Both read and unread)

```Text dart
fynoInApp.fynoInAppState.count
```

2. Count of unread InApp notifications

```Text dart
fynoInApp.fynoInAppState.unreadCount
```

3. List of all InApp notifications (Both read and unread)

```Text dart
fynoInApp.fynoInAppState.list
```

4. List of unread InApp notifications

```Text dart
fynoInApp.fynoInAppState.unreadList
```

5. Current page number

```Text dart
fynoInApp.fynoInAppState.page
```

6. To mark all InApp notifications as Read

```Text dart
fynoInApp.markAllAsRead()
```

7. To delete all InApp notifications

```Text dart
fynoInApp.deleteAllMessages()
```

8. To mark a single InApp notifications as Read

```Text dart
fynoInApp.markAsRead(notification)
// pass one of the items from the list: fynoInApp.fynoInAppState.list
```

9. To delete a single InApp notification

```Text dart
fynoInApp.deleteMessage(notification)
// pass one of the items from the list: fynoInApp.fynoInAppState.list
```

10. To load more notifications (based on pagination)

```Text dart
fynoInApp.loadMoreNotifications(page, type)
// type -> 'all' or 'unread', page should be greater than zero
```

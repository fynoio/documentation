A **Workspace** is an environment within the Fyno application specific only to your company's organisation. **Workspaces** allows you to collaborate, delegate access and manage projects easily with team members.

**Workspaces** allow you to

1. Segregate and create different environments for different teams.
2. Allow access to relevant personnel only, via role-based restriction on the activities that can be done on the Fyno App.
3. Easy segregation of data, based on teams or functions, however you like!
4. Have secure and compliant environments to work in.

## Creating a Workspace

Fyno team will create the first Workspace when we onboard a new customer and assign a Owner to that workspace.

Post that, only a Workspace Owner can create a new Workspace.

Click the drop-down and click on **View All** to see all the workspaces that you have been invited to or have access to.

## Adding Team members to your Workspace

Having a **Workspace** means collaborating with colleagues and working together! Read more about [Adding Team](/docs/team#creating-and-viewing-team-members) members to your **Workspace**!

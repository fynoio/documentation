**Team** is a structure that Fyno built for you to work and collaborate seamlessly with your colleagues.

But in order to understand how the **Team** function works, we will first need to understand what a **Workspace** is and how that functions. Read more [here]().

The structuring and functioning of a **Team** works based on roles and access assigned to each team member.

> 👍 On signing up and creating a new account with Fyno your **Default Workspace** is created and the registered email ID will be the Organisation Owner!

## The Need for Teams

**Teams** allows you to:

1. Provide restricted access to individual employees as per their role requirements.
2. Have a centralized view of the team members along with their access levels and other details
3. Collaborate easily with colleagues on projects and tasks within the Fyno Application.

## Roles

The below roles with unique levels of access have been created so that you can assign relevant roles to each person, based on what they need to access.

| Access                        | Owner | Workspace Admin | Developer | Support |
| :---------------------------- | :---- | :-------------- | :-------- | :------ |

A **Delivery Webhook** is nothing but an **Allowlist** URL that can receive updates from Fyno regarding the delivery status of the notifications sent out and easily share the delivery details with you, to a location of your convenience, pre-decided by you.

An **Allowlist** URL can be converted anytime to a **Delivery Webhook**, once it is successfully verified by following the below steps while adding Allowlist URL/SQS.

1. Select the checkbox - 'Use this endpoint to receive delivery reports' and click 'Add'.
2. In the window that opens, you can add additional configurations, based on your requirements. You can also alternatively scroll to the bottom and save. This will send you the basic details that are pre-configured at Fyno's end.

The first Delivery Endpoint you create will be considered as 'Default' and you will start receiving your delivery reports in that URL. At any point of time, there will be only one default Allowlist URL. If you want to receive delivery reports in other URLs other than default URLs, you need to specify it in the payload as explained in the next section.

Once this is done, all the delivery statuses for every notification triggered will be automatically updated at this location.

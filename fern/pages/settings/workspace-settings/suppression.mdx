A suppression list is a list of destinations (users) that you do not want to send notifications because sending to these destinations will hurt delivery rates.

For example, users whose emails have bounced, those without WhatsApp who cannot receive messages, those with incorrectly captured mobile numbers preventing them from receiving WhatsApp or SMS, and users who have complained about excessive notifications and requested to stop sending any notifications to them will be placed on the suppression list. They will be excluded from any notifications triggered from Fyno.

## How to create a Suppression List

1. To create a Suppression List, go to Workspace Settings(bottom left corner in menu) -> Add On's -> Suppression List.

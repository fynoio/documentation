On the "Log Details" pop-up, the fourth tab on the ribbon menu you will see is "Response".

In this tab, you will find everything to do with the response received for the notification that was triggered to the "Provider"

Fyno will display the exact response that has been received from the "Provider", including details like

1. Error code, if any
2. Final status of the notification
3. Message "Content" as well as "Trace" details

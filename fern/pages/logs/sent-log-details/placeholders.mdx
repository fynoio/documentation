On the "Log Details" pop-up, the second tab on the ribbon menu you will see is "Placeholders".

"Placeholders" shows you the details of all the placeholders or the replaceable parameters that were in the "Template" that was used to trigger the notification event.

> ðŸ“˜ No details in "**Placeholders**"?
>
> If the "Placeholders" tab shows no details, this only means that the content that was triggered in the notification had no replaceable parameters to be displayed

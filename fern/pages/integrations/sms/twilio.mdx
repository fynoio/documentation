Before we get started, you will need to have a Twilio account already set up, along with a Messaging Service SID.

<Steps>

### Find the Provider

Navigate to the Integrations page. Find "SMS" and click on the "Twilio" button.

### Configure the Integration

In the pop-up, fill in:

-   **Custom name**: Provide a name to help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.

-   **Account SID**: In your Twilio account, under the Account tab on the top right corner, find API Keys and Tokens. Make sure to use the live credentials

-   **Auth Token**: In your Twilio account, Under the Account tab on the top right corner, find API Keys and Tokens. Use the eye icon to display the Auth token. Make sure to use the live credentials.

-   **Messaging Service SID**: In your Twilio account, Under the Develop section on the left navigation menu, find Messaging and navigate to Services. Either create a new Messaging Service or use an existing one.

### Complete the Integration

Click on "Add Account" once done, and you are all set!

</Steps>

## Message Delivery Status

Twilio, by default, provides the status of the message without any additional setup needed.

Once the above integration is complete, the status of the notification, which will be shared by Twilio will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

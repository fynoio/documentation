## Message Delivery Status

While Fyno has the capacity to track the notification delivery status, TrustSignal requires a manual update of the Fyno Callback Endpoint in order to receive these reports. To update the Callback manually follow these steps:

1. Log into your TrustSignal Messaging Account.
2. On the left navigation, go to _SMS -> SMS Settings -> SMS Webhook. _
3. On the page that opens, enter the URL given in the TrustSignal Integration popup and Save.

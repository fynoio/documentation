Before we get started, you will need to have a Mtalkz account already set up, along with SenderID and Templates.

<Steps>

### Find the Provider

Navigate to the Integrations page. Under "SMS" section, click on the "Mtalkz" button.

### Configure the Integration

In the pop-up, fill in:

-   **Custom name**: Provide a name that would help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.

-   **API Key**: On your Mtalkz Account, you can access the API key from Account settings.

-   **Sender**: Enter the Sender ID that you want to use.

-   **DLT Entity Id**: Enter your DLT registered Entity ID

### Complete the Integration

Click on "Add Account" once done, and you are all set!

</Steps>

## Message Delivery Status

Mtalkz, by default, provides the status of the message without any additional setup needed.

Once the above integration is complete, the status of the notification, which will be shared by Mtalkz will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

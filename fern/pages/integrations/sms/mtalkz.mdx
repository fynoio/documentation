Before we get started, you will need to have a Mtalkz account already set up, along with SenderID and Templates.

1. Navigate to Integrations.

2. Under "SMS" section, click on the "Mtalkz" button.

3. In the pop-up, fill in:

    1. **Custom name**: Provide a name that would help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.
    2. **API Key**: On your Mtalkz Account, you can access the API key from Account settings.
    3. **Sender**: Enter the Sender ID that you want to use.
    4. **DLT Entity Id**: Enter your DLT registered Entity ID

4. Click on "Test Integration" once done. If the account is successfully connected, you will see a success message.

## Message Delivery Status

Mtalkz, by default, provides the status of the message without any additional setup needed.

Once the above integration is complete, the status of the notification, which will be shared by Mtalkz will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

Before we get started, you will need to have an MSG91 account already set up, along with SenderID added.

<Steps>

### Find the Provider

Navigate to the Integrations page. Find "SMS" and click on the "MSG91" button.

### Configure the Integration

In the pop-up, fill in:

-   **Custom name**: Provide a name to help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.

-   **Auth Key**: Enter the Auth Key from MSG91 account. You can find this in the Configurations Section, under "Auth Key". Create a new one, or use an existing one.

-   **Sender**: Enter the Sender ID that you want to use.

-   **Route**: Select the route from the drop-down depending on the message type - Transactional, Promotional or OTP.

### Complete the Integration

Click on "Add Account" once done, and you are all set!

</Steps>

## Message Delivery Status

While Fyno has the capacity to track the notification delivery status, MSG91 requires a manual update of the Fyno Callback Endpoint in order to receive these reports. To update the Callback manually follow these steps:

<Steps>

    <Step>Log in to your MSG91 account.</Step>

    <Step>
        Navigate to **Configuration** and find "**Webhook**" from the left
        navigation bar
    </Step>

    <Step>
        Configure the POST URL (URL can be retrieved from the integration page
        on Fyno): ![](/images/6f5b8dc-MSG91-callback.jpg)
    </Step>

</Steps>

You can now send a test message from Fyno using MSG91 as the **Provider** and see the delivery logs updated in your **Sent logs**.

Before we get started, you will need to have a telSpiel account already set up, along with SenderID and Templates.

1. Navigate to Integrations.

2. Under "SMS" section, click on the "telSpiel" button.

3. In the pop-up, fill in:

    1. **Custom name**: Provide a name that would help you identify the configured account in Fyno's application.
    2. **Username/AccountId**: Provide the username/AccountId of your telSpiel account
    3. **API Key**: To get API key, you need to send an email to [care@telspiel.com.](mailto:care@telspiel.com.)
    4. **Sender**: Enter the Sender ID that you want to use.
    5. **Entity Id **: Enter your DLT registered Entity ID. You will get this from your DLT platform.

4. Click on "Test Integration" once done. If the account is successfully integrated, you will see a success message.

## Message Delivery Status

TelSpiel does not provide the status of the message by default. To enable tracking delivery status, follow the below steps.

1. Send an email to [care@telspiel.com](mailto:provisioning@karix.com) requesting the activation of delivery tracking. Ensure you include the Callback URL provided in the Karix Integration popup within your email.
2. Enable "custref" in the webhook URL

Once the above integration is complete, the status of the notification, which will be shared by Karix will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

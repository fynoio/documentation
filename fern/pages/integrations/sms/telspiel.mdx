Before we get started, you will need to have a telSpiel account already set up, along with SenderID and Templates.

<Steps>

### Find the Provider

Navigate to the Integrations page. Under "SMS" section, click on the "telSpiel" button.

### Configure the Integration

In the pop-up, fill in:

- **Custom name**: Provide a name that would help you identify the configured account in Fyno's application.

- **Username/AccountId**: Provide the username/AccountId of your telSpiel account

- **API Key**: To get API key, you need to send an email to [care@telspiel.com.](mailto:care@telspiel.com.)

- **Sender**: Enter the Sender ID that you want to use.

- **Entity Id**: Enter your DLT registered Entity ID. You will get this from your DLT platform.

### Complete the Integration

Click on "Add Account" once done, and you are all set!

</Steps>

## Message Delivery Status

TelSpiel does not provide the status of the message by default. To enable tracking delivery status, follow the below steps.

<Steps>

    <Step>Send an email to [care@telspiel.com](mailto:care@telspiel.com) requesting the activation of delivery tracking. Ensure you include the Callback URL provided in the telSpiel Integration popup within your email.</Step>

    <Step>Enable "custref" in the webhook URL</Step>

</Steps>

Once the above integration is complete, the status of the notification, which will be shared by Karix will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

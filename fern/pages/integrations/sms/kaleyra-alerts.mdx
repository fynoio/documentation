Before we get started, you will need to have a Kaleyra Alerts account already set up, along with SenderID and Templates.

1. Navigate to Integrations and click on the "Providers" tab on the drop-down menu
2. Find "SMS" and click on the "Kaleyra Alerts" button.
3. In the pop-up, fill in:
    1. **Custom name**: Provide a name that would help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.
    2. **API Key**: Enter the API key generated from your Kaleyra Alerts application.
    3. **Sender**: Enter the Sender ID that you want to use.
4. Click on "Add Account" once done, and you are all set!

## Message Delivery Status

Kaleyra Alerts, by default, provides the status of the message without any additional set-up needed.

Once the above integration is complete, the status of the notification, which will be shared by Kaleyra will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

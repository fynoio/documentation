## Message Delivery Status

While Fyno has the capacity to track the notification delivery status, India SMS requires a manual update of the Fyno Callback Endpoint in order to receive these reports. To update the Callback manually follow these steps:

1. Log into your India SMS Account.
2. Configure the URL given in the India SMS Integration popup and Save.

Before we get started, you will need to have a Syniverse account already set up, along with SenderID and registered numbers assigned. Alternatively, you can use the number that are publicly available on the platform for testing.

<Steps>

### Find the Provider

Navigate to the Integrations page. Find "SMS" and click on the "Syniverse" button.

### Configure the Integration

In the pop-up, fill in:

- **Custom name**: Provide a name that would help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.

- **Access Token**: Login into your Syniverse account. On the Applications page, find the Application that you would like to connect and click on it. On the page that loads, find "**Auth Keys**" section and expand it to find "**Access Token**". Copy the same and paste it in the "**Access Token**" field of the Fyno integration page.

- **Sender Address/Channel**: Login into your Syniverse account. On the Applications page, find "**Voice and Messaging Console**" and click on it. You will be prompted to select an account. Please select the relevant account and click on "**Select**". On the page that opens, from the left navigation panel, find "**Messaging Account** and expand it to find "**Private Channels**". Select the Channel you would like to connect and copy the channel ID. On the Fyno platform, you will need to enter - "_channel:_" followed by your channel ID you just copied.

### Complete the Integration

Click on "Add Account" once done, and you are all set!

</Steps>

## Message Delivery Status

While Fyno has the capacity to track the notification delivery status, Syniverse requires a manual update of the Fyno Callback Endpoint in order to receive these reports. To update the Callback manually follow these steps:

<Steps>

<Step>Log into your Syniverse Account. On the Homepage, find "**Event Manager**" and expand the menu. Click on "**Delivery Configurations**"</Step>

<Step>On the page that loads, find and click on "**New Delivery Configuration**". In the pop-up that appears, provide it a suitable name, enter the Fyno Callback URL, with the "**Delivery Protocol**" set to **REST** and the "**Delivery Format**" set to **JSON**, and click on **Save**.</Step>

<Step>
  Once done, from the "**Event Manager**" menu, find and click on "**Subscriptions**". On the page that loads, click on "**New Subscription**". In the pop-up that loads, fill in the below details:
  <ul>
    <li>**Topic:** SCG-Message</li>
    <li>**Event Type:** All types</li>
    <li>**Delivery Configuration:** The configuration that was created above.</li>
    <li>**Matching Criteria:** You may leave this blank.</li>
    <li>**Start Time:** Enter a time and date.</li>
    <li>**End time:** We advise to leave this blank, thus not having an expiration date for the Callback URL.</li>
  </ul>
</Step>

<Step>Once done, click on **Create**.</Step>

</Steps>

You can now send a test message from Fyno using Syniverse as the **Provider** and see the delivery logs updated in your **Sent logs**.

## Message Delivery Status

JioCx does not provide the status of the message by default. You will need to contact Jio to enable callback URL given in the JioCx Integration popup and status updates via webhooks.

Once the above integration is complete, the status of the notification, which will be shared by JioCx will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

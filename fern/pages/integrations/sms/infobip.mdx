## Message Delivery Status

Infobip, by default, provides the status of the message without any additional setup needed.

Once the above integration is complete, the status of the notification, which will be shared by Infobip will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

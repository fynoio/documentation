Before we get started, you will need to have a Infobip account already set up, along with SenderID and Templates.

1. Navigate to Integrations.

2. Under "SMS" section, click on the "Infobip" button.

3. In the pop-up, fill in:

    1. **Custom name**: Provide a name that would help you identify the configured account in Fyno's application.
    2. **infobip Base URL**: You can find it in Infobip home page as shown below. It will be in the format _xxxxx.api.infobip.com._

    3. **API Key**: Once you login into Infobip, go to Menu -> Developer Tools -> API Key. You can either copy the API Key of a previously created one or create a new one.

    4. **Sender**: Enter the Sender ID that you want to use.
    5. **Entity Id (DLT)**: Enter your DLT registered Entity ID. You will get this from your DLT platform.

4. Click on "Test Integration" once done. If the account is successfully integrated, you will see a success message.

## Message Delivery Status

Infobip, by default, provides the status of the message without any additional setup needed.

Once the above integration is complete, the status of the notification, which will be shared by Infobip will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

    2. **Username**: Enter the username you use to log into Route Mobile.
    3. **Password**: Enter the password you use to log into Route Mobile.
    4. **Sender**: Provide the Sender ID that you want to use with this integration

## Message Delivery Status

Route Mobile, by default, provides the status of the message without any additional set-up needed.

Once the above integration is complete, the status of the notification, which will be shared by Route Mobile will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the Delivery tab.

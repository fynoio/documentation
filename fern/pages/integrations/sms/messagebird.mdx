Before we get started, you will need to have a MessageBird account already set up, along with SenderID and Templates.

<Steps>

### Find the Provider

Navigate to Integrations page. Find "SMS" and click on the "MessageBird" button.

### Configure the Integration

In the pop-up, fill in:

-   **Custom name**: Provide a name to help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.

-   **API Key**: Find your API Key by clicking on the "Developers" tab on the navigation bar on the left and selecting "API Access" in your MessageBird login. You can either create a new one or use an existing one.

-   **Originator**: Enter the Sender ID that you want to use.

### Complete the Integration

Click on "Add Account" once done, and you are all set!

</Steps>

## Message Delivery Status

MessageBird, by default, provides the status of the message without any additional set-up needed.

Once the above integration is complete, the status of the notification, which will be shared by MessageBird will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

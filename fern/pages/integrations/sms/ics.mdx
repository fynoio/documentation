Before we get started, you will need to have a ICS account already set up, along with SenderID and Templates.

1. Navigate to Integrations.
2. Under "SMS" section, click on the "ICS" button.
3. In the pop-up, fill in:

    1. **Custom name**: Provide a name that would help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.
    2. **UserID**: The CustomerID that is displayed on your ICS Account when you log in and view the dashboard
    3. **Password**: Password used to log into the Customer ID entered in the previous field
    4. **Sender**: The Sender that is being used by you to send out messages.
    5. **Entity Id**: The Entity ID that is registered with DLT Platform

4. Click on "Add Account" once done, and you are all set!

## Message Delivery Status

While Fyno has the capacity to track the notification delivery status, ICS requires a manual update of the Fyno Callback Endpoint in order to receive these reports. To update the Callback manually follow these steps:

1. Log into your ICS Account.
2. Configure the URL given in the ICS Integration popup and Save.

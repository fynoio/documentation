Before we get started, you will need to have a Gupshup account already set up, along with SenderID and Templates. 

1. Navigate to Integrations and click on the "Providers" tab on the drop-down menu
2. Find "SMS" and click on the "Gupshup" button.
3. In the pop-up, fill in:
   1. **Custom name**: Provide a name that would help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.
   2. **UserID**: The CustomerID that is displayed on your Gupshup Account when you log in and view the dashboard
   3. **Password**: Password used to log into the Customer ID entered in the previous field
   4. **Source**: The SenderID (Mask) that is being used by you to send out messages.
4. Click on "Add Account" once done, and you are all set!

## Message Delivery Status

While Fyno has the capacity to track the notification delivery status, Gupshup requires a manual update of the Fyno Callback Endpoint in order to receive these reports. To update the Callback manually follow these steps:

1. Log into your Gupshup Messaging Account.
2. Click on **Settings** on the Menu bar and find **Advance Account Settings**.
3. On the page that opens, find **Realtime Delivery URL** and enter Fyno's URL. (This will be shared on request).

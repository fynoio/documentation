Before we get started, you will need to have a Gupshup account already set up, along with SenderID and Templates.

<Steps>

### Find the Provider

Navigate to the Integrations page. Find "SMS" and click on the "Gupshup" button.

### Configure the Integration

In the pop-up, fill in:

- **Custom name**: Provide a name that would help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.

- **UserID**: The CustomerID that is displayed on your Gupshup Account when you log in and view the dashboard

- **Password**: Password used to log into the Customer ID entered in the previous field

- **Source**: The SenderID (Mask) that is being used by you to send out messages.

### Complete the Integration

Click on "Add Account" once done, and you are all set!

</Steps>

## Message Delivery Status

While Fyno has the capacity to track the notification delivery status, Gupshup requires a manual update of the Fyno Callback Endpoint in order to receive these reports. To update the Callback manually follow these steps:

<Steps>

<Step>Log into your Gupshup Messaging Account.</Step>

<Step>Click on **Settings** on the Menu bar and find **Advance Account Settings**.</Step>

<Step>On the page that opens, find **Realtime Delivery URL** and enter Fyno's URL.</Step>

</Steps>

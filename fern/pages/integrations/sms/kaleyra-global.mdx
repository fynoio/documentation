Before we get started, you will need to have a Kaleyra Global account already set up, along with SenderID and Templates.

<Steps>

### Find the Provider

Navigate to the Integrations page. Find "SMS" and click on the "Kaleyra Global" button.

### Configure the Integration

In the pop-up, fill in:

- **Custom name**: Provide a name that would help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.

- **API Key**: Enter the API key generated from your Kaleyra Global application.

- **Sender**: Enter the Sender ID that you want to use.

### Complete the Integration

Click on "Add Account" once done, and you are all set!

</Steps>

## Message Delivery Status

Kaleyra Global, by default, provides the status of the message without any additional set-up needed.

Once the above integration is complete, the status of the notification, which will be shared by Kaleyra will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

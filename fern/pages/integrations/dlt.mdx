<Note>Applicable only if you are an Indian entity sending SMSes in India</Note>

DLT, or Distributed Ledger Technology, is a blockchain based technology used by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) to check for unsolicited SMSs sent to the end users. It was activated as the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference (TCCCP) Regulations in April, 2021. Post these regulations, principal entities (PEs) can only send SMSs which are registered on the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) platform.

## Why is DLT registration required to send SMS?

DLT registration is a compulsory mandate by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) for any entity wishing to dispatch SMS messages within India. This technology aims to curb spam, enhance the satisfaction of telecom subscribers, and bolster trust and safety.

## How to apply for DLT registration for sending SMS in India?

Any business or organization operating in India with a legitimate business registration and intending to send SMS to Indian users is eligible to apply for DLT registration.

Individual applicants are not qualified for DLT registration.

If you fulfil these criteria, you can initiate the DLT registration by completing the application form and submitting it to TRAI.

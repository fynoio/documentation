## What is DLT registration?

DLT, or Distributed Ledger Technology, is a blockchain based technology used by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) to check for unsolicited SMSs sent to the end users. It was activated as the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference (TCCCP) Regulations in April, 2021. Post these regulations, principal entities (PEs) can only send SMSs which are registered on the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) platform.

DLT registration is a compulsory mandate by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) for any entity wishing to dispatch SMS messages within India. This technology aims to curb spam, enhance the satisfaction of telecom subscribers, and bolster trust and safety.

**Fyno Push** combines 3 different push notification services, in one plugin. You can integrate one or all of them to get the best possible outcome in terms of push notification delivery.

> ðŸš§ Minimum requirements!

> You will need to install and configure Google FCM as default/primary provider, if nothing else, to make Fyno Push functional.

The Push providers in **Fyno Push** that you can configure are:

1. [Google FCM](./push-fcm)
2. [MI Push](./push-mi-push)
3. [APNS](./push-apns)

> ðŸ˜Ž Did you notice that the integrations will cover all mobile device operating systems?
>
> Fyno Push was designed to address this problem. One integration, with the capability to deliver push notifications all mobile devices!

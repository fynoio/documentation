Before integrating OneSignal with Fyno, you will need to have an account already set up in OneSignal with an App built (SDK)

<Steps>
### Find the Provider
Navigate to the Integrations page. Under "Push" section, click on the "OneSignal" button.

### Configure the Integration

In the pop-up that appears, fill in:

- **Custom name:** Provide a name that would help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.
- **App ID:** From your OneSignal application, navigate to the Settings option from the ribbon menu and find "**Keys & IDs**" on the secondary ribbon menu and enter the App ID Key.
- **Access Token:** From your OneSignal application, navigate to the Settings option from the ribbon menu and find "**Keys & IDs**" on the secondary ribbon menu and enter the Rest API Key.

### Complete the Integration

Click on "Add Account" once done and you are all set!

</Steps>

## Message Delivery Status

OneSignal, by default, provides the status of the message without any additional set-up needed. You will only need to make sure to deploy Fyno's SDK with your application.

Once the above integration is complete, the status of the notification, which will be shared by OneSignal will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

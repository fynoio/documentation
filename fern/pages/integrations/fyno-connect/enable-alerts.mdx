Alerts are designed to help get your attention to any deviants from the norm on the Fyno Connect platform.

Let's get right into it!

There are 2 types of **Alerts** you can set up for your account.

1. Campaign Failure
2. Connect Downtime

## Campaign Failure

Campaign is the critical part of Fyno Connect's functionality. So if a campaign fails, it is important to ensure you are aware of it. For this, **Campaign Failure** alerts can be used to ensure you are on top of this.

**Campaign Failure**alert is significant since it can help you detect when any of your Campaigns are failed to send and you can take quick corrective action.

### How it works

On enabling the **Campaign Failure** notification,

1. Whenever an Campaign fails, a notification will be triggered.
2. To avoid spamming, Fyno has designed the **Digest** feature to work in tandem with the **Campaign Failure** feature. This:
    1. Intakes all the notifications for an Campaign failure and buckets them into each reason for failure.
    2. Incrementally conveys this information, until the time it is resolved, in a summarised manner in the below-mentioned windows:
        1. 30 minutes
        2. 2 hours
        3. 6 hours
        4. 12 hours
        5. 24 hours

> üëç You will receive emails at these intervals for Campaign failures. You will also receive an InApp notification on your Fyno account with more details of the failure.

<br />

### Enabling Campaign Failure

To activate **Campaign Failure** alerts on your account, follow the below steps.

1. Tap on **Profile** icon on the top right corner of the navigation menu and click '**Workspace Settings**'
2. Navigate to **Alerts** tab.

4. Click 'Configure & Manage users'. In the pop-up window, fill in the email addresses of the persons you want an email to be sent to whenever there is an campaign failure on your account.

> üëç You can add upto 5 Email IDs to receive communication for any campaign that has failed.

## Connect Downtime

**Connect Downtime **alerts are set up for you to understand in case there are any application or performance issues with the Fyno Connect.

While we do not expect the application to face downtimes or have issues that would hinder your communications from going out, it is always good to know in case it does happen.

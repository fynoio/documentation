Push notification applications are a rage and have in the past couple of years been a real game changer in terms of notifications.

As communication methods are getting more complex and have more alternative routes and options for delivery, push notifications are turning out to be an easy option in terms of integration as well as usability.

Keeping this in mind, let's have a look into the integration processes for some Push notification providers.

1. [APNs](push-apns)
2. [Expo](push-expo)
3. [FCM](push-fcm)
4. [Fyno Push](./push-fyno)
5. [Mi Push](push-mi-push)
6. [OneSignal](push-onesignal)

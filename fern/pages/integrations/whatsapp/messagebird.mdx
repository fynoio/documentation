Before we get started, you will need an active WhatsApp number as well as templates pre-configured in your Kaleyra.io account

<Steps>
### Find the Provider
Navigate to the Integrations page. Under "WhatsApp" section, click on the "MessageBird" button.

### Configure the Integration

In the pop-up that appears, fill in:

-   **Custom name:** Provide a name that would help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.

-   **API Key:** In your MessageBird account, find your API Key by clicking on the "Developers" tab on the navigation bar on the left and selecting "API Access". You can either create a new one or use an existing one.

-   **From:** From the MessageBird application, navigate to Channels from the navigation panel on the left and select "WhatsApp". Copy the "Channel ID" from the WhatApp number you want to use.

-   **Namespace:** From the Channels page on your MessageBird account, select WhatsApp. Copy the Template WhatsApp Namespace ID from the desired WhatsApp number.

### Complete the Integration

Click on "Add Account" once done, and you are all set!

</Steps>

## Message Delivery Status

MessageBird, by default, provides the status of the message without any additional set-up needed.

Once the above integration is complete, the status of the notification, which will be shared by MessageBird will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

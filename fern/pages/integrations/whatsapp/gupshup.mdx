Before we get started, you will need an active WhatsApp number as well as templates pre-configured in your Gupshup.io account

2. Under "WhatsApp" section, click on the "Gupshup" button.
3. In the pop-up that appears, fill in:

    1. **Custom name:** Provide a name that would help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.
    2. **API Key** - You will get API key from settings.
    3. **Bot Name** - You will get Bot Name from settings. App name is the Bot name
    4. **App ID** - You will get App ID from settings.
    5. **From phone No** - Enter the registered Business Number that you would like to use and enter the same without the "+" symbol.
4. Click on "Test Integration" once done. If the account is successfully connected, you will see a success message.

## Message Delivery Status

While Fyno has the capacity to track the notification delivery status, Gupshup requires a manual update of the Fyno Callback Endpoint in order to receive these reports. To update the Callback manually follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Gupshup account.
2. On the top navigation pane, find and click on **Webhooks**.

3. On the page that loads, add the callback URL from the Gupshup integration popup in Callback URL field.
4. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select all the Message events and System events under 'Message events settings'.
5. We recommend you test the configuration once by clicking on **Test** at the top right corner of the page to make sure the configuration is working as expected.

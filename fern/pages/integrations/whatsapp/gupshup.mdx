### Complete the Integration

## Message Delivery Status

While Fyno has the capacity to track the notification delivery status, Gupshup requires a manual update of the Fyno Callback Endpoint in order to receive these reports. To update the Callback manually follow these steps:

<Steps>
    <Step>Log in to your Gupshup account.</Step>
    <Step>
        On the top navigation pane, find and click on **Webhooks**.
        ![](/images/whatsapp_gupshup_callback.png)
    </Step>
    <Step>
        On the page that loads, add the callback URL from the Gupshup
        integration popup in Callback URL field.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Scroll to the bottom of the page and select all the Message events and
        System events under 'Message events settings'.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        We recommend you test the configuration once by clicking on **Test** at
        the top right corner of the page to make sure the configuration is
        working as expected.
    </Step>

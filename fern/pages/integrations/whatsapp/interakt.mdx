4. Click on "Test Integration" once done. If the account is successfully connected, you will see a success message.

## Message Delivery Status

While Fyno has the capacity to track the notification delivery status, Interakt requires a manual update of the Fyno Callback Endpoint in order to receive these reports. To update the Callback manually follow these steps:

1. Log into your Interakt Account
2. From the top right corner, find **Developer Setting** and click on **Configure** under Configure Webhook.
3. On the page that loads, enter the Callback URL provided in the popup in Webhook URL. Enter the Secret Key.

4. Under **Template Messages sent via API** and **Template Message sent via Interakt Campaigns**, select all the required options and click Submit.
5. Test your integration by sending a message from the Fyno App. You will be able to see this in the the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

Before we get started, you will need an active WhatsApp number as well as templates pre-configured in your AiSensy account.

Apart from this, you will also need to create a campaign in your AiSensy Account with the desired template as an **API Campaign**.

<Steps>

### Find the Provider

Navigate to the Integrations page. Under "WhatsApp" section, click on the "AiSensy" button.

### Configure the Integration

In the pop-up that appears, fill in:

- **Custom name:** Provide a name that would help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.

- **API Key:** From your AiSensy account, navigate to **Manage** on the left navigation panel and then click on "**API Key**". On the new page, find the API Key and click on **Copy API Key**. Paste the same on Fyno's integration page.

### Complete the Integration

Click on "Add Account" once done, and you are all set!

</Steps>

Before we get started, you will need to have an MSG91 account already set up.

1. Navigate to Integrations.
2. Under "WhatsApp" section, click on the "MSG91" button.
3. In the pop-up, fill in:
    1. **Custom name**: Provide a name to help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.
    2. **API Key**: Enter the Auth Key from MSG91 account. Go to navigation menu -> Settings -> Auth Key. Create a new one, or use an existing one.
    3. **From Number**: Enter the registered Business Number that you would like to use (including ISD code) and enter the same without the "+" symbol. Example - 919876543210
4. Click on "Test Integration" once done. If the account is successfully connected, you will see a success message.

## Message Delivery Status

While Fyno has the capacity to track the notification delivery status, MSG91 requires a manual update of the Fyno Callback Endpoint in order to receive these reports. To update the Callback manually follow these steps:

1. Log in to your MSG91 account.
2. Navigate to **Configuration** and find "**Webhook**" from the left navigation bar
3. Configure the URL given in the MSG91 Integration popup

You can now send a test message from Fyno using MSG91 as the **Provider** and see the delivery logs updated in your **Sent logs**.

---

Before we get started, you will need to have an MSG91 account already set up.

<Steps>
### Find the Provider
Navigate to the Integrations page. Under "WhatsApp" section, click on the "MSG91" button.

### Configure the Integration

In the pop-up, fill in:

- **Custom name**: Provide a name to help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.
- **API Key**: Enter the Auth Key from MSG91 account. Go to navigation menu -> Settings -> Auth Key. Create a new one, or use an existing one.
- **From Number**: Enter the registered Business Number that you would like to use (including ISD code) and enter the same without the "+" symbol. Example - 919876543210

### Complete the Integration

Click on "Add Account" once done, and you are all set!

</Steps>

## Message Delivery Status

While Fyno has the capacity to track the notification delivery status, MSG91 requires a manual update of the Fyno Callback Endpoint in order to receive these reports. To update the Callback manually follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step>Log in to your MSG91 account.</Step>
  <Step>Navigate to **Configuration** and find "**Webhook**" from the left navigation bar.</Step>
  <Step>Configure the URL given in the MSG91 Integration popup ![](/images/whatsapp_msg91_callback.png)</Step>
</Steps>

You can now send a test message from Fyno using MSG91 as the **Provider** and see the delivery logs updated in your **Sent logs**.

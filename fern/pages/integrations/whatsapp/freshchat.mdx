Before we get started, you will need an active WhatsApp number as well as templates pre-configured in your Freshchat account.

1. Navigate to Integrations.
2. Under "WhatsApp" section, click on the "Freshchat" button.
3. In the pop-up that appears, fill in:
    1. **Custom name:** Provide a name to help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.
    2. **Freshchat Domain:** This can be found on Freshchat by navigating to Settings on the left navigation panel and then clicking on "Admin Settings". On the page that opens, scroll down to "Website Tracking and APIs" and click on **API Settings**. On the new page, confirm CAPTCHA to view the details and copy the details from "Your Chat URL".
    3. **Namespace:** Log into your Meta Business Manager Suite and click on "Settings" and click on "WhatsApp Accounts". Then, click on the WhatsApp account from the list to display the account settings and at the bottom, click on "**WhatsApp Manager"**. On the WhatsApp Manager page, under Account Tools on the left, click on "Message Templates". On the new page, find and click the "**Namespace**" button next to the filters, and from the pop-up, copy the namespace.
    4. **From Phone Number:** Navigate to Settings on the left navigation panel and then click on "Admin Settings". On the page that opens, under Chat Channels, find and click on **WhatsApp**. From the list, copy the registered Business Number that you would like to use and enter the same without the "+" symbol.
    5. **Freshchat API Key:** This can also be found on Freshchat by navigating to Settings on the left navigation panel and then clicking "Admin Settings".

4. Click on "Test Integration" once done. If the account is successfully connected, you will see a success message.

## Message Delivery Status

Freshchat, by default, provides the status of the message without any additional set-up needed.

Once the above integration is complete, the status of the notification, which will be shared by Freshchat will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

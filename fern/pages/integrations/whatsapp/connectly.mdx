Before we get started, you will need an active WhatsApp number as well as templates pre-configured in your Connectly account.

<Steps>

### Find the Provider

Navigate to the Integrations page. Under "WhatsApp" section, click on the "Connectly" button.

### Configure the Integration

In the pop-up that appears, fill in:

-   **Custom name:** Provide a name that would help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.

-   **Business ID:** From your Connectly account, navigate to **Settings** on the left navigation panel and on the page that opens, find "**API Key and Webhook Secret**". Click on **Generate API Key** to find the **Business ID**.

-   **From WhatsApp Number:** Enter the registered WhatsApp number that is linked to your Connectly Account. You can find this on the **Settings** page by navigating to the **General**, under **Messaging Channels**

-   **API Key:** From your Connectly account, navigate to **Settings** on the left navigation panel and on the page that opens, find "**API Key and Webhook Secret**". Click on **Generate API Key** to find the **API Key**.

### Complete the Integration

Click on "Add Account" once done and you are all set!

</Steps>

## Message Delivery Status

Connectly does not provide the status of the message by default. You will need to send a mail to your Connectly Account Manager to help you set this up and ask them to configure the webhook URL given in the Connectly Integration popup in your Connectly account.

Once the above integration is complete, the status of the notification, which will be shared by Connectly will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

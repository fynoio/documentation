## Message Delivery Status

Connectly does not provide the status of the message by default. You will need to send a mail to your Connectly Account Manager to help you set this up and ask them to configure the webhook URL given in the Connectly Integration popup in your Connectly account.

Once the above integration is complete, the status of the notification, which will be shared by Connectly will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

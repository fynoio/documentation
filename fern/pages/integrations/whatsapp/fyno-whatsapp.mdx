## Sign up flow

The sign-up experience for creating a Meta-verified WhatsApp account might vary based on the situation youâ€™re in.

Youâ€™ll fall into one of these three scenario:

1. You have an existing WhatsApp Business account with a BSP (and youâ€™re migrating to Fyno)
2. You wish to add a WhatsApp account to an Existing Facebook Business Account
3. You are starting from Scratch â€” Creating a Facebook Business account and a WhatsApp business account for your business.Â Fyno helps you establish both.

## Scenario 1: You have an existing WhatsApp Business Account with a BSP

There are two scenarios here.

1. You would like to move your existing WhatsApp account from your existing BSP to Fyno.
2. You might have an existing WhatsApp account connected with a BSP, but you would like to add a new WhatsApp number with Fyno (for different purposes â€” say support, or sales queries, etc.)

The assumption here is that you already have an existing verified Meta Business account.

## How to setup integration

1. Click on the Integrations on the navigation bar and select Fyno WhatsApp.
2. Enter a Custom Name (for example: fyno-whatsapp-meta) and then click Login with Facebook.

### Creating and syncing WhatsApp templates

If you have existing WhatsApp templates, you can sync them to Fyno.

-   Go to **Template > External** from the left sidebar and click on the sync icon, which is present right before the **+ Create** button.
-   Now, all your existing WhatsApp templates will be synced to Fyno.
-   If you donâ€™t have existing templates, you can create new ones from Fyno by clicking on the **+ Create** button. The newly created templates will be approved within a few minutes.
-   Please note that in order to test these templates using the new WhatsApp number, you shouldâ€™ve added the payment method in your Facebook Business account.

### **Adding a payment method**

-   Log into your Facebook Business Account
-   Click on the **Settings** section on the left sidebar.
-   Select **Billing and Payments**. Youâ€™ll see two tabs once youâ€™re in â€” **Ad accounts** and **WhatsApp Business Accounts**.

-   After adding your credit card details, you can test WhatsApp notifications for the new WhatsApp number.

## Scenario 2: Adding WhatsApp to an existing Facebook Business Account

If youâ€™re adding a new number to your existing Facebook business account, the process involved is very similar to the steps mentioned in **Scenario 1**.

Log into your Fyno account, click on **Integrations,** choose **Fyno WhatsApp** and follow the instructions on the screen.

## **Scenario 3: Creating a Facebook Business account and a WhatsApp business account from scratch**

If you neither have a Facebook Business account nor a WhatsApp business account, youâ€™ll have to start by creating a Facebook Business account first

### Creating a Facebook Business Account

Youâ€™ll require the following documents to create a Meta-verified Facebook

-   **Postpaid Phone Number:**Â A business phone number must be registered on a postpaid plan under your company's name.
-   **GST Registration:**Â The GST registration certificate, which serves as the official proof of your business.
-   **Company Website:**Â Please ensure that your company website clearly displays your legal company name somewhere on the website â€” could be the footer, privacy policy, the about section, etc.
-   **WhatsApp Number:**Â Make sure you select the number you want associated with your official WhatsApp business account!
-   **Credit Card with International Limits:**Â Ensure your company credit card permits international transactions before starting the signup process.

**Edge cases:**

-   **For Educational Institutions and sole proprietorship**: If youâ€™re an educational institution or a sole proprietor, you are exempt from GST. In that case, you can use your institutionâ€™s incorporation certificates for signing up.
-   **If your new number already has a WhatsApp account**: In that case, youâ€™ll have to install WhatsApp on your phone, and deactivate the existing personal WhatsApp account.

If youâ€™re creating a new Facebook business account, it might take up to 48 hours for it to get approved.

Once your Facebook Business account is verified, you can create a WhatsApp Business Account by the following the steps mentioned under **Scenario 1.**

### Important points to remember:

1. Youâ€™ll have to add a payment method to your Facebook Business account, as youâ€™ll be directly billed by Meta going forward.
2. WhatsApp carefully monitors how recipients interact with messages from your Business account. Initially, you'll be limited to 1,000 messages per day. As you build positive interactions, your account can progress to the 10k and 100k daily message tiers. However, if customers frequently mark your messages as spam or block your account, your quality rating drops. Low ratings will hinder your ability to move to the next tier and could even lead to template deactivation or, in severe cases, account deactivation by WhatsApp.
3. If you donâ€™t have a credit card with International transactions enabled, we advise you to talk to your bank or relationship manager to enable it. If you canâ€™t, we have a workaround.
4. In the absence of a card with international transactions enabled, your account will linked to our credit line partner, who will raise an invoice for your WhatsApp usage every month. Everything else will be taken care of by Fyno on the backend.

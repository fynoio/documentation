Before we get started, you will need an active WhatsApp number as well as templates pre-configured in your ValueFirst account.

<Steps>
### Find the Provider
Navigate to the Integrations page. Under "WhatsApp" section, click on the "ValueFirst" button.

### Configure the Integration

In the pop-up, fill in:

-   **Custom name**: Provide a name to help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.
-   **Token**: A token needs to be created, following the [guide](https://fynodocs.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/images/UserGuide_ValueFirst_Channel_v1.2.1+.pdf) provided by Value First (Page 6, Token Generation)
-   **From Number**: Enter the from number that you want to integrate and trigger messages through.

### Complete the Integration

Click on "Add Account" once done, and you are all set!

</Steps>

## Message Delivery Status

ValueFirst, by default, provides the status of the WhatsApp messages without any additional setup needed.

Once the above integration is complete, the status of the notification, which will be shared by ValueFirst will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

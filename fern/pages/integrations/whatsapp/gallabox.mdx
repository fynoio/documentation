Before we get started, you will need an active WhatsApp number as well as templates pre-configured in your Gallabox account.

1. Navigate to Integrations.
2. Under "WhatsApp" section, click on the "Gallabox" button.
3. In the pop-up, fill in:

    1. **Custom name**: Provide a name to help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.
    2. **Access Token**: In your Gallabox account, in the left navigation, Integrations -> Configuration and copy the Access Token

4. Click on "Run Test" once done. If the account is successfully connected, you will see a success message.

## Message Delivery Status

While Fyno has the capacity to track the notification delivery status, Gallabox requires a manual update of the Fyno Callback Endpoint in order to receive these reports. To update the Callback manually follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Gallabox account.
2. On the left navigation pane, find and click on **Integrations**.
3. On the page that loads, under Configuration tab, add callback URL (you can get it from the integration popup) in Status URL field

Before we get started, you will need an active WhatsApp number as well as templates pre-configured in your Yellow.ai account.

1. Navigate to Integrations.
2. Under "SMS" section, click on the "Yellow.ai" button.
3. In the pop-up, fill in:

    1. **Custom name**: Provide a name to help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.
    2. **Bot Id**: To obtain the bot ID, you can click on the web link from any page of the bot after creating it and copy the 14-digit alphanumeric value (e.g., x16763649\*\*). The bot ID is different in each environment.

## Message Delivery Status

Yellow.ai, by default, provides the status of the WhatsApp messages without any additional setup needed.

Once the above integration is complete, the status of the notification, which will be shared by Yellow.ai will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

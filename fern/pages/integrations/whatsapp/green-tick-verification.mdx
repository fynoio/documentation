A “Green Tick” next to your company name shows customers you're a legitimate business– but getting approved by Meta requires some work. You’ll need the following information handy to get your business green tick verified.

-   **Logo:** Make sure the image is in **500px by 500px** resolution.
-   **Short Business Profile:** Update your description, email address, and contact details. Crucially, your **legal company name must match exactly** across all Meta account fields where it appears.
-   **Links for Social Proof:** You need a minimum of 3 links showing official websites/publications where your company name is listed: (Crunchbase, Tofler, Company Directories, etc.)

Submit for review with just a couple of clicks. Approvals generally take upto 48 hours, but if something is a mismatch, your application won’t be approved. In that case, you’ll have to wait for 2 weeks before you can apply again.

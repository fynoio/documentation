Before we get started, you will need an active WhatsApp number as well as templates pre-configured in your Gupshup Enterprise account

<Steps>
### Find the Provider
Navigate to the Integrations page. Under "WhatsApp" section, click on the "Gupshup Enterprise" button.

### Configure the Integration

In the pop-up that appears, fill in:

- **Custom name:** Provide a name that would help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.
- **Username:** Provide the username that you use to sign into your Gupshup Enterprise Account.
- **Password:** Provide the password that you use to sign in, corresponding to the same Gupshup Enterprise account

### Complete the Integration

Click on "Add Account" once done, and you are all set!

</Steps>

<Tip title="WhatsApp Template registration process for Gupshup Enterprise">Gupshup Enterprise requires you to provide the body of message content even for templatized messages. So, when you configure a Gupshup Enterprise account in our provider list, you will be required to provide the body of the message for template messages also.</Tip>

## Message Delivery Status

While Fyno has the capacity to track the notification delivery status, Gupshup Enterprise requires a manual update of the Fyno Callback Endpoint in order to receive these reports. To update the Callback manually follow these steps:

<Steps>

<Step>Log in to your [Gupshup Analytics account](https://unify.smsgupshup.com/WhatsApp/Analytics/views/integration/webhooks/outbound/list).</Step>

<Step>On the left navigation pane, find and click on **Integrations**.</Step>

<Step>On the page that loads, again on the left navigation panel, find **Webhooks** and click on WhatsApp Message Delivery Events.</Step>

<Step>Scroll to the bottom of the page and enter given in the Gupshup Enterprise Integration popup in the field mentioned as Notification Callback URL and select the forward method as **JSONBODY** and click on **Submit** at the end of the page.</Step>

<Step>We recommend you test the configuration once by clicking on **Test** at the top right corner of the page to make sure the configuration is working as expected.</Step>

</Steps>

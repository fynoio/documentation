Before we get started, you will need an active WhatsApp number as well as templates pre-configured in your Twilio account

<Steps>
### Find the Provider
Navigate to the Integrations page. Under "WhatsApp" section, click on the "Twilio" button.

### Configure the Integration

In the pop-up that appears, fill in:

- **Custom name:** Provide a name to help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.
- **Account SID:** In your Twilio Account, under the Account tab in the top right corner, find API Keys and Tokens. Make sure to use the live credentials
- **Auth Token:** In your Twilio Account, Under the Account tab on the top right corner, find API Keys and Tokens. Use the eye icon to display the Auth token. Make sure to use the live credentials.
- **From Number:** The registered WhatsApp number that you would like to use to initiate conversations.

### Complete the Integration

Click on "Add Account" once done, and you are all set!

</Steps>

## Message Delivery Status

Twilio, by default, provides the status of the message without any additional set-up needed.

Once the above integration is complete, the status of the notification, which will be shared by Twilio will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

Communication platforms have become so interactive these days that creating an "App" and plugging it in to your Slack or Discord apps to provide you updates or send interactive messages are a common and convenient task. All notifications in one place! Easy!

Integrating the apps itself is very simple and is a one step process, however, the App would need to be up and running, executing some function or task, which would then run via Fyno's App.

Before we get started, you will need to have a Gupshup Enterprise account already set up, along with SenderID and Templates.

1. Navigate to Integrations.
2. Under "RCS" section, click on the "Gupshup Enterprise" button.
3. In the pop-up, fill in:

    1. **Custom name**: Provide a name that would help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.
    2. **UserID**: The CustomerID that is displayed on your Gupshup Enterprise Account when you log in and view the dashboard
    3. **Password**: Password used to log into the Customer ID entered in the previous field

## Message Delivery Status

While Fyno has the capacity to track the notification delivery status, Gupshup Enterprise requires a manual update of the Fyno Callback Endpoint in order to receive these reports. To update the Callback manually follow these steps:

1. Copy the Callback URL in the Integrations popup
2. Send the Callback URL to your Gupshup account manager to add it in your Gupshup account.

Before integrating Sparkpost with Fyno, you will need to have an account already set up with Sparkpost.

1. Navigate to Integrations.
2. Under "Email" section, click on the "Sparkpost" button.
3. In the pop-up that appears, fill in:
    1. **Custom name:** Provide a name that would help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.
    2. **Sparkpost Region**: You can choose either Default or EU based on your location.
    3. **SMTP User:** From your Sparkpost account, navigate to Configuration -> SMTP Settings and select SMTP user.
    4. **Password:** Enter the password associated with the SMTP User that was entered in the above field.
    5. **From Name:** Enter the name that you want to be displayed to the recipient on receiving this email.
    6. **From Email:** Enter the Email ID from which the emails will be sent from. This must be an email ID with a domain that is already registered with Sparkpost.
    7. **Password:** Enter the name associated with the Sender that was entered in the "From Email" field.
    8. **Content type:** You can choose either "Text/Plain" (no rich content in emails, simple plain text) or "Text/HTML" (Rich content including images, buttons and links will be supported) depending on the type of content you intend on pushing in the templates.
    9. **Reply To:** This is an optional field. You may enter an alternate email ID so that when the recipient clicks on "Reply", the email ID you have entered in the "Reply To" will be populated. This can be different from the "From" email ID.
4. Click on "Add Account" once done and you are all set!

## Message Delivery Status

While Fyno has the capacity to track the notification delivery status, Sparkpost requires a manual update of the Fyno Callback Endpoint in order to receive these reports. To update the Callback manually follow these steps:

1. Log into your Sparkpost account and click on the "Configurations" tab on the top navigation panel and go to "**Webhooks**".
2. On clicking on "**Webhooks**" you will be able to add Fyno's webhook for each event type by clicking on "**Create Webhook**". Please create and add a webhook for all the statuses with Fyno's callback URL given in the Sparkpost Integration popup.

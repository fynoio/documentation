---

Before we get started, you will need to have a Kaleyra Voice account already set up, along with numbers assigned and IVRs pre-created.

1. Navigate to Integrations from the left hand menu.
2. On the page that opens, find "Voice" and click on the "Kaleyra" button.
3. In the pop-up, fill in:
    1. **Custom name**: Provide a name that would help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.
    2. **API Key**: Enter the API Key copied from your Kaleyra Voice Platform from the Developers section.
    3. **Caller ID**: Enter the caller ID for the number/IVR that you intend on triggering with this integration.
    4. **IVR/Call Flow ID**: From your Kaleyra Voice platform, on the main IVR Studio page, find the IVR/Call Flow ID for the corresponding flow you would like to use, and enter the same with the prefix "ivr:" (This needs to be in lower case only.) **Example:** ivr:12345
4. Click on "Add Account" once done and you are all set!

## Message Delivery Status

Kaleyra Voice, by default, provides the status of the message without any additional set-up needed.

Once the above integration is complete, the status of the notification, which will be shared by Kaleyra will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

> Does your IVR flow have a Keypress capturing requirement? If yes, you will need to configure Fyno's webhook to capture these details. Contact us to help set this up!

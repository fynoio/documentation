- **Auth Token**: In your Twilio account, Under the Account tab on the top right corner, find API Keys and Tokens under Account Management tab. Use the eye icon to display the Auth token. Make sure to use the live credentials.
- **API Key and API Secret**: You can create a new API key or use an exisiting API Key. You can do it from Account Management -> Keys & Credentials -> API Keys & Tokens

## Message Delivery Status

Twilio, by default, provides the status of the message without any additional setup needed.

Once the above integration is complete, the status of the notification, which will be shared by Twilio will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

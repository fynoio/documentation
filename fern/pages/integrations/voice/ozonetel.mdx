---

Before we get started, you will need to have a Ozonetel account already set up, along with numbers assigned and IVRs pre-created. Make sure you have created at least 1 inbound or outbound campaign.

<Steps>
### Find the Provider
Navigate to the Integrations page. On the page that opens, find "Voice" and click on the "Ozonetel" button.

### Configure the Integration

In the pop-up, fill in:

- **Custom name**: Provide a name that would help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.
- **API Key**: Enter the API Key from your Ozonetel Platform. You can access it from _Home page -> Edit Profile_
- **Username**: Enter the Username from your Ozonetel Platform. You can access it from _Home page -> Edit Profile_
- **DID/Caller ID**: Enter the caller ID for the number/IVR that you intend on triggering with this integration. You can access it from _Campaigns -> Inbound/Outbound Campaigns_.
- **Campaign Name**: From your Ozonetel platform, you can access it from _Campaigns -> Inbound/Outbound Campaigns _

Click on "Add Account" once done and you are all set!

</Steps>

## Message Delivery Status

While Fyno has the capacity to track the notification delivery status, Ozonetel requires a manual update of the Fyno Callback Endpoint in order to receive these reports. To update the Callback manually follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step>Log in to your Ozonetel account.</Step>
  <Step>Enter Fyno's Callback URL given in the Ozonetel Integration popup and select the relevant notifications required and save the same.</Step>
  <Step>Test your integration by sending a message from the Fyno App. Your notification delivery status will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip title="Keypress Capture?">Does your IVR flow have a Keypress capturing requirement? If yes, you will need to configure Fyno's webhook to capture these details. Contact us to help set this up!</Tip>

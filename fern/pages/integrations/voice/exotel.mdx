Before we get started, you will need to have a Exotel Voice account already set up, along with numbers assigned and IVRs pre-created.

1. Navigate to Integrations from the left hand menu.
2. On the page that opens, find "Voice" and click on the "Exotel" button.
3. In the pop-up, fill in:
    1. **Custom name**: Provide a name that would help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.
    2. **API Key**: From your Exotel account, on the top, find API Credentials and click on it. On the page that opens you will find your pre-created API Keys. Alternatively, you can create a new one.
    3. **API Token**:From your Exotel account, on the top, find API Credentials and click on it. On the page that opens you will find your pre-created API Keys and the corresponding token. Enter the token for the API Key used above.
    4. **Region**: From the API Credential page, you can also find the region of your account. Select the region relevant to your system configuration. This can be:
        1. Singapore
        2. Mumbai
    5. **Account SID**:From your Exotel account, on the top, find API Credentials and click on it. On the page that opens you will find your Account SID and enter it here.
    6. **Expo Phone No./Caller ID**: From the homepage of your Exotel account, find the **Manage** section and click on **ExoPhones**. On the page that opens, find the number you would like to use and enter it here.
    7. **IVR/Call Flow ID**: From the homepage of your Exotel account, find the **Manage** section and click on **App Bazaar**. On the page that opens, find the IVR Call/Flow ID you would like to use and enter it here.
4. Click on "Test Integration" once done. If the account is successfully connected, you will see a success message.

## Message Delivery Status

Exotel, by default, provides the status of the message without any additional set-up needed.

Once the above integration is complete, the status of the notification, which will be shared by Kaleyra will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

> Does your IVR flow have a Keypress capturing requirement? If yes, you will need to configure Fyno's webhook to capture these details. Contact us to help set this up!

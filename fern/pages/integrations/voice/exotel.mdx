Before we get started, you will need to have a Exotel Voice account already set up, along with numbers assigned and IVRs pre-created.

<Steps>
### Find the Provider
Navigate to the Integrations page. On the page that opens, find "Voice" and click on the "Exotel" button.

### Configure the Integration

In the pop-up, fill in:

- **Custom name**: Provide a name that would help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.

- **API Key**: From your Exotel account, on the top, find API Credentials and click on it. On the page that opens you will find your pre-created API Keys. Alternatively, you can create a new one.

- **API Token**: From your Exotel account, on the top, find API Credentials and click on it. On the page that opens you will find your pre-created API Keys and the corresponding token. Enter the token for the API Key used above.

- **Region**: From the API Credential page, you can also find the region of your account. Select the region relevant to your system configuration. This can be:

  - Singapore
  - Mumbai

- **Account SID**: From your Exotel account, on the top, find API Credentials and click on it. On the page that opens you will find your Account SID and enter it here.

- **Expo Phone No./Caller ID**: From the homepage of your Exotel account, find the **Manage** section and click on **ExoPhones**. On the page that opens, find the number you would like to use and enter it here.

- **IVR/Call Flow ID**: From the homepage of your Exotel account, find the **Manage** section and click on **App Bazaar**. On the page that opens, find the IVR Call/Flow ID you would like to use and enter it here.

### Complete the Integration

Click on "Add Account" once done, and you are all set!

</Steps>

## Message Delivery Status

Exotel, by default, provides the status of the message without any additional set-up needed.

Once the above integration is complete, the status of the notification, which will be shared by Kaleyra will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

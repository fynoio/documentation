These notifications lack a visible user interface element but come with valuable data payloads. To effectively use this feature, you must create a notification template in the Fyno application, specifying the template type as "silent." Additionally, developers must integrate the `onMessageReceived` event handler into the In-App SDK configuration to capture these silent notifications.

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide on creating a silent notification template in Fyno and capturing these notifications in your application.

## Creating a Silent Notification Template in Fyno

To create a silent notification template in Fyno, follow these steps:

1. **Accessing Fyno Application**: Access your Fyno account and navigate to the Templates section.
2. **Template Creation**:
    - Click the "Create Template" button or edit an existing template.
    - Set the template type to "Silent." This indicates that this notification template will be used for sending silent notifications.
    - Define the data payload.
    - You can leave placeholders for content that can be dynamically filled by your application.
3. **Final Step**: Save and promote your template and It's ready to use

### Capturing silent notification in your application

To capture the incoming silent notification in your application, You need to pass the event handlers(`onMessageReceived` and `onMessageClicked`) to the In-App SDK

1. **SDK Integration**:  
   Ensure you have integrated the Fyno's In-App SDK into your application by following the [Integration Guide](https://docs.fyno.io/recipes/fynos-in-app-sdk-reactjs).
2. **Configure Event Handlers**  
   While configuring the SDK, include `onMessageReceived` and `onMessageClicked` event handler props and pass your custom message handler methods.  
   Define the message handler functions in your application to handle incoming silent notifications and to handle notification click/deleted events.

    In your messageHandler function, access the silent notification data payload and perform actions based on the received data. For example

    ```
    const onMessageHandler = (incoming) => {
      // Handle the silent notification data payload here
      const data = incoming.notification.additional_data
      // Perform actions based on the data received
    }

    <FynoInappCenter {...config} onMessageReceived={onMessageHandler} onMessageClicked={onClickHandler}/>
    ```

> ðŸ“˜ Note
>
> Ensure you are using @fyno/inapp-react library - **v1.0.15 or later.**

### Use Case

Consider a scenario where users initiate payments in your application, and you want to send silent notifications to update payment information in real-time without disrupting users with visible notifications. Follow these steps to achieve this

```
const messageHandler = (notification) => {
  // Handle the silent notification data payload
  const data = notification.notification_content.additional_data

  // Update the state information in your app
  updatePaymentInformation(data)
}

<FynoInappCenter {...config} onMessageReceived={messageHandler} />
```

### Conclusion

By creating a silent notification template in Fyno and configuring the In-App SDK with the `onMessageReceived` event handler, developers can easily send and capture silent notifications in their applications. This feature enables non-intrusive updates and real-time data synchronisation while delivering a seamless user experience.

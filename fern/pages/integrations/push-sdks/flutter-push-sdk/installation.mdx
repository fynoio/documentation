To integrate the Fyno SDK into your Flutter application, you need to add the `fyno_flutter` package to your project's dependencies. You can add the package using one of the following commands:

```Text bash
dart pub add fyno_flutter
```

OR

```Text bash
flutter pub add fyno_flutter
```

Alternatively, you can manually edit the `pubspec.yaml` file in your project and add `fyno_flutter` to the `dependencies` section:

Find the latest version at [Fyno Flutter Push SDK](https://pub.dev/packages/fyno_flutter)

```Text yaml
dependencies:
    ...
    fyno_flutter: <latest_version>
    ...
```

After adding the dependency, make sure to run `flutter pub get` to fetch and install the required packages

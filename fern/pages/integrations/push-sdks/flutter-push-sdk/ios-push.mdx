To enable push notifications for iOS, you need to configure specific capabilities and handle the necessary app delegate code. Let's walk through the steps.

### Step 0: Update iOS pods

1. Run `pod install` in the ios folder of your flutter application to install/update the pod dependencies.

### Step 1: Add capabilities in iOS application

1. Open your Flutter project in Xcode.
2. Inside the **Targets** section, select your app target, and go to **Signing & Capabilities**.
3. Click on **+ Capability** and add **Push Notifications** and **Background Modes** capabilities.

4. In Background Modes, select the Remote Notifications option. This is required to receive background push notifications. Learn more about background notifications [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/pushing_background_updates_to_your_app).

### Step 2: Register for push notification in AppDelegate.swift file

To handle push notifications in your iOS app, add the following code to `AppDelegate.swift`:

1. Import the required packages:

```Text swift
import UIKit
import Flutter
import fyno_push_ios
```

2. If you are using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), add the Firebase imports:

```Text swift
import FirebaseCore
import FirebaseMessaging
```

3. Extend `FlutterAppDelegate` and implement the necessary methods:

```Text swift
@UIApplicationMain
@objc class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
    let fynosdk = fyno.app

    override func application(
        _ application: UIApplication,
        didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
    ) -> Bool {
        GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: self)

        UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = fynosdk

        self.fynosdk.registerForRemoteNotifications()

        fynosdk.requestNotificationAuthorization { _ in }

        FirebaseApp.configure() // Optional: Configure Firebase if FCM is used

        return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
    }

    override func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError error: Error) {
        print("Failed to register for remote notifications: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }

    override func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
        fynosdk.setdeviceToken(deviceToken: deviceToken)

      	Messaging.messaging().apnsToken = deviceToken // Optional: Set APNs token for FCM
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Add a Notification Service Extension

To ensure rich push notifications and proper handling of incoming messages, add a `Notification Service Extension` to your iOS project:

1. In Xcode go to **File** > **New** > **Target**.
2. Select `Notification Service Extension` from the template list.
3. Provide a product name, select your development team, choose Swift as the language, and click Finish.

4. Replace the contents of the generated `NotificationService.swift` file with the following code:

```Text NotificationService.swift
import UserNotifications
import UIKit
import fyno

class NotificationService: UNNotificationServiceExtension {
    var contentHandler: ((UNNotificationContent) -> Void)?
    var bestAttemptContent: UNMutableNotificationContent?

    override func didReceive(_ request: UNNotificationRequest, withContentHandler contentHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationContent) -> Void) {
        fyno.app.handleDidReceive(request, withContentHandler: contentHandler)
    }

    override func serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire() {
        if let contentHandler = contentHandler, let bestAttemptContent = bestAttemptContent {
            contentHandler(bestAttemptContent)
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Add Fyno SDK to the Notification Service Extension

To allow the Notification Service Extension to use the Fyno SDK, you need to import it:

1. In Xcode, select your Notification Service Extension target.
2. Under `Frameworks and Libraries`, click on the **+** button.

3. Under `Add Other`, click on the `Add Package Dependency`.

4. Search for `https://github.com/fynoio/ios-sdk` in the text box.
5. Select and add the `ios-sdk` package.

6. Ensure the target is set to the Notification Service Extension you created, then click `Add Package`.

Q. Build Issue: Error (Xcode): Cycle inside Runner; building could produce unreliable results

A. In **Xcode** > **Targets** > **Runner** > **Build Phases**, drag and arrange Embed Frameworks, [CP] Embed Pods Frameworks, and Embed Foundation Extensions so that they are above **Run Script**. Refer [this](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/730974) for more details.

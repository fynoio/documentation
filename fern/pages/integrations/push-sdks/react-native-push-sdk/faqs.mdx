**Q. Build Issue**

Error (Xcode): Cycle inside Runner; building could produce unreliable results

**A.** In **Xcode** > **Targets** > **Runner** > **Build Phases**, drag and arrange Embed Frameworks, [CP] Embed Pods Frameworks, and Embed Foundation Extensions so that they are above **Run Script**. Refer [this](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/730974) for more details.

**Q. Pod install issue**

[!] The following Swift pods cannot yet be integrated as static libraries:

The Swift pod `fyno-push-ios` depends upon `FMDB`, which does not define modules. To opt into those targets generating module maps (which is necessary to import them from Swift when building as static libraries), you may set `use_modular_headers!` globally in your Podfile, or specify `:modular_headers => true` for particular dependencies.

**A.** Add `use_modular_headers!` in your Podfile similar to:

```Text Podfile
target '<application_name>' do
  use_modular_headers!
```

Also, comment the `:flipper_configuration => flipper_config,` line.

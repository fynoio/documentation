To enable push notifications for iOS, you need to configure specific capabilities and handle the necessary app delegate code. Let's walk through these steps.

### Step 0: Update iOS pods

1. Run `pod install` in the ios folder of your React Native application to install/update the pod dependencies.

### Step 1: Add capabilities in iOS application

1. Open your React Native project in Xcode.
2. Inside the **Targets** section, select your app target, and go to **Signing & Capabilities**.
3. Click on **+ Capability** and add **Push Notifications** and **Background Modes** capabilities.

4. In Background Modes, select the Remote Notifications option. This is required to receive background push notifications. Learn more about background notifications [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/pushing_background_updates_to_your_app).

### Step 2: Register for push notification in AppDelegate.mm file

To handle push notifications in your iOS app, add the following code to `AppDelegate.mm`:

1. Import the required packages:

```Text Obj-C
#import "AppDelegate.h"

#import <React/RCTBundleURLProvider.h>

#import <UserNotifications/UserNotifications.h>
#import <FirebaseMessaging/FirebaseMessaging.h>
#import <FirebaseCore/FirebaseCore.h>
#import <fyno/fyno-Swift.h>
```

2. In `AppDelegate.m` file, copy paste the below code:

```Text Obj-C
@interface AppDelegate () <UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate>
@property (nonatomic, strong) fyno *fynosdk;
@end

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
  ...
  UNUserNotificationCenter.currentNotificationCenter.delegate = self.fynosdk;
  self.fynosdk = [fyno app];

  [self.fynosdk registerForRemoteNotifications];
  ...
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError *)error {
  NSLog(@"Failed to register for remote notifications: %@", error.localizedDescription);
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken {
  // Send the device token to fynoServer
  [self.fynosdk setdeviceTokenWithDeviceToken:deviceToken];
}

...
```

### Step 3: Add a Notification Service Extension

To ensure rich push notifications and proper handling of incoming messages, add a `Notification Service Extension` to your iOS project:

1. In Xcode go to **File** > **New** > **Target**.
2. Select `Notification Service Extension` from the template list.
3. Provide a product name, select your development team, choose Objective-C as the language, and click Finish.

Replace the contents of the generated `NotificationService.m` file with the following code:

```Text NotificationService.m
#import "NotificationService.h"
#import <fyno/fyno-Swift.h>
#import <FirebaseCore/FirebaseCore.h>
#import <FirebaseMessaging/FirebaseMessaging.h>

@interface NotificationService ()

@property (nonatomic, strong) void (^contentHandler)(UNNotificationContent *contentToDeliver);
@property (nonatomic, strong) UNMutableNotificationContent *bestAttemptContent;

@end

@implementation NotificationService

- (void)didReceiveNotificationRequest:(UNNotificationRequest *)request withContentHandler:(void (^)(UNNotificationContent * _Nonnull))contentHandler {
  [[fyno app] handleDidReceive:request withContentHandler:contentHandler];
}

- (void)serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire {
    // Called just before the extension will be terminated by the system.
    // Use this as an opportunity to deliver your "best attempt" at modified content, otherwise the original push payload will be used.
    self.contentHandler(self.bestAttemptContent);
}

@end

```

### Step 4: Add Fyno SDK to the Notification Service Extension

In order for the Notification Service Extension to be able to access **fyno** and the **Firebase SDKs**, you will have to import it by following the below steps:

Select the framework named **fyno.xcframework** and click on **Add**

![](https://fynodocs.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/images/react_ios_7.png)

Search for `https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk` in the text box. Select and add the package named **firebase-ios-sdk**.

Scroll down to find **FirebaseMessaging** and add it to the Notification Service Extension you had created.

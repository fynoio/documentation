To integrate the Fyno SDK into your React Native application, you need to add the `@fyno/react-native` package to your project's dependencies. You can add the package using one of the following commands:

```Text bash
npm install @fyno/react-native
```

OR

```Text bash
yarn add @fyno/react-native
```

Alternatively, you can manually edit the `package.json` file in your project and add `@fyno/react-native` to the `dependencies` section:

Find the latest version at [Fyno React Native Push SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fyno/react-native)

```Text yaml
"dependencies": {
    ...
    "@fyno/react-native": "<latest_version>",
    ...
},
```

After adding the dependency, make sure to run `npm install` or `yarn install` to fetch and install the required packages

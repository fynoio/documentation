Fyno In-App is our very own internally built notification application that can be integrated with your application and act as a notification method, be it within your web application or mobile application.

We at Fyno understand how important it is to keep things simple, because of this the process of integrating our native In-App is made super easy.

All you will need to do is navigate to Integrations.

1. Under "In-App" section, click on the "Fyno In-App" button.
2. In the pop-up that appears, fill in:
    1. **Custom name:** Provide a name that would help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.
    2. **Token:** Token is pre-filled by Fyno's application since this is our native application.
    3. **Request Origin URL:** The URL of the website into which the In-App will be integrating to. For Example, the URL needs to be provided as "demoapp.fyno.io" and NOT as "https://demoapp.fyno.io".

> 👍 Handling Sub-Domains
>
> For the **Request Origin URL**, in case you want to cover all the subdomains, all you will need to do is preceed your domain URL with an **`*` ** (asterisk). This will help the system understand that all subdomains of that URL needs to be handled via this integration.

## Message Delivery Status

Fyno In-App, by default, provides the status of the message without any additional setup needed. You will only need to make sure to deploy Fyno's SDK with your application.

Once the above integration is complete, the notification status, which will be shared by Fyno's In-App will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

> 🚧 Fyno's In-App is meant to be used as an SDK!
>
> While the testing and set up can be done on the application interface, the actually implication of the application is via SDK.
>
> The SDK and installation guide for Fyno's In-App can be found in [Recipes Section ](https://docs.fyno.io/recipes/fynos-in-app-sdk-nodejs)of our documentation. Alternatively, you can also find the same documentation in [Fyno's Github Repo](https://github.com/fynoio/inapp-react)

## Testing Fyno's In-App

The In-App is an SDK that would work within your mobile app when you have successfully integrated it. But of course, you will need to test it before you integrate it!

And we have thought of that too!

Check out our [In-App Sandbox/ Simulator page](https://demoapp.fyno.io/) here and give the In-App feature a whirl!

You can use the simulator with the default configurations that it comes with, or even key in your Fyno's credentials and details from the **Settings** option on the page and customize the test notifications!

## Message Delivery Status

Fyno Web Push, by default, provides the status of the message without any additional set-up needed.

Once the above integration is complete, the status of the notification, which will be shared by Fyno Web Push will be displayed in the logs, when you click on it, under the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab.

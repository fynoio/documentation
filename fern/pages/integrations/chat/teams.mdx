Teams, by Microsoft, is one of the biggest internal communication channels. With that in mind, having notification integrations that can seamlessly send out either a mass blast or personalised communication has become the need of the hour.

And we're here for it.

Teams can be integrated in 2 ways, depending on your requirement:

1. Teams Incoming Webhook
2. Teams Bot App

To understand each the capabilities of each integration method, here is a handy list for you:

| Action                             | Teams Incoming Webhook | Teams Bot App |
| :--------------------------------- | :--------------------- | :------------ |
| Able to message individual person  | Yes                    | No            |
| Able to message group chat         | Yes                    | No            |
| Able to message public channel     | Yes                    | Yes           |
| Able to message private channel    | No                     | Yes           |
| Able to send card message          | Yes                    | Yes           |
| Able to send welcome message       | Yes                    | No            |
| Able to retrieve Teams context     | Yes                    | No            |
| Require installation step on Teams | Yes                    | No            |
| Require Azure resource             | Azure Bot Service      | No            |

The integration process also varies, depending on the method. Let's have a look at this now.

### Teams Incoming Webhook

1. Navigate to Integrations.
2. Under "Chat" section, click on the "Teams" button.
3. In the pop-up that appears, fill in:
    1. **Custom name:** Provide a name to help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.
    2. **Incoming Webhook:** Log into your Teams Account and :
        1. Find the channel you want to connect to. Click on the menu option next to it and click on "**Connectors**"
        2. In the pop-up that opens, find "**Categories**" and select **All**.
        3. In the list Find **Incoming Webhook**" and click on configure.
        4. In the new pop-up, fill in the name, provide a logo (optional) and click on create.
        5. This will create. a URL in the same pop-up. This can now be used in Fyno's integration page.
4. Click on "Add Account" once done and you are all set!

### Teams Bot App

If you would like to integrate a bot that you have already built or would like to create and integrate a new bot, we got you!

Reach out to us now at **[support@fyno.io](mailto:support@fyno.io)** and we will take care of the rest!

## Message Delivery Status

Teams (by Microsoft), by default, does not provide the status of the notification sent out. This is not a configurable feature as well.

As and when this becomes a supported feature, Fyno will integrate the same into the application.

In the meantime, for every **Trace ** for Teams, the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab under **Trace ** will not be seen.

Teams, by Microsoft, is one of the biggest internal communication channels. With that in mind, having notification integrations that can seamlessly send out either a mass blast or personalised communication has become the need of the hour.

And we're here for it.

Teams can be integrated in 2 ways, depending on your requirement:

1. Teams Incoming Webhook
2. Teams Bot App

To understand each the capabilities of each integration method, here is a handy list for you:

| Action                             | Teams Incoming Webhook | Teams Bot App |
| :--------------------------------- | :--------------------- | :------------ |
| Able to message individual person  | Yes                    | No            |
| Able to message group chat         | Yes                    | No            |
| Able to message public channel     | Yes                    | Yes           |
| Able to message private channel    | No                     | Yes           |
| Able to send card message          | Yes                    | Yes           |
| Able to send welcome message       | Yes                    | No            |
| Able to retrieve Teams context     | Yes                    | No            |
| Require installation step on Teams | Yes                    | No            |
| Require Azure resource             | Azure Bot Service      | No            |

The integration process also varies, depending on the method. Let's have a look at this now.

### Teams Incoming Webhook

<Steps>
### Find the Provider
Navigate to the Integrations page. Under "Chat" section, click on the "Teams" button.

### Configure the Integration

In the pop-up that appears, fill in:

- **Custom name:** Provide a name to help you identify the configured account in Fyno's portal.
- **Incoming Webhook:** Log into your Teams Account and:
  <ol>
    <li>Find the channel you want to connect to. Click on the menu option next to it and click on "**Connectors**"</li>
    <li>In the pop-up that opens, find "**Categories**" and select **All**.</li>
    <li>In the list Find **Incoming Webhook**" and click on configure.</li>
    <li>In the new pop-up, fill in the name, provide a logo (optional) and click on create.</li>
    <li>This will create. a URL in the same pop-up. This can now be used in Fyno's integration page.</li>
  </ol>

</Steps>

If you would like to integrate a bot that you have already built or would like to create and integrate a new bot, we got you!

Reach out to us now at **[support@fyno.io](mailto:support@fyno.io)** and we will take care of the rest!

## Message Delivery Status

Teams (by Microsoft), by default, does not provide the status of the notification sent out. This is not a configurable feature as well.

As and when this becomes a supported feature, Fyno will integrate the same into the application.

In the meantime, for every **Trace** for Teams, the **[Delivery](./log-details-delivery)** tab under **Trace** will not be seen.
